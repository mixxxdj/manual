<dt id="term-AAC">AAC</dt><dd><p>Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a patented audio compression algorithm which
uses a form of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-lossy"><span class="xref std std-term">lossy</span></a> data compression. Designed to be the successor
to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MP3"><span class="xref std std-term">MP3</span></a>, AAC generally achieves better sound quality at similar bit
rates. While the .aac extension is sometimes used for AAC-encoded files,
they are typically saved with an .m4a file extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-AcoustID">AcoustID</dt><dd><p>An acoustic fingerprint system built entirely on <a class="reference internal" href="#term-open-source"><span class="xref std std-term">open-source</span></a>
technology. It aims to create a free database of user-submitted audio
fingerprints with mapping to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MusicBrainz"><span class="xref std std-term">MusicBrainz</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="#term-metadata"><span class="xref std std-term">metadata</span></a>
database and provide a web service for audio file identification using this
database. For more information, see`&lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://acoustid.org/">https://acoustid.org/</a>&gt;`_.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-AIFF">AIFF</dt><dd><p>Short for Audio Interchange File Format. High-quality digital audio file
format, similar to .wav files. Contains CD-quality audio stored in a
non-compressed, <a class="reference internal" href="#term-lossless"><span class="xref std std-term">lossless</span></a> format. AIFF files generally end with a
.aiff or .aif extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-ALAC">ALAC</dt><dd><p>Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) is a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-lossless"><span class="xref std std-term">lossless</span></a> audio file format
used by iTunes and other Apple products. ALAC files use the same MP4
container format as AAC and use the same file extensions (m4a, mp4). Mixxx
and many other programs are not compatible with ALAC. It is recommended
to convert ALAC files to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-FLAC"><span class="xref std std-term">FLAC</span></a> for use in Mixxx.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-API">API</dt><dd><p>An Application Program Interface (API) is a specification and set of rules
for how software programs interact with each other. In Mixxx, an example of
this is the Sound API that Mixxx uses to communicate with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><span class="xref std std-term">Operating System</span></a> to make use of the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-soundcards"><span class="xref std std-term">soundcards</span></a> connected to
the computer.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-audio-interface">audio interface</dt><dt id="term-audio-interfaces">audio interfaces</dt><dd><p>An audio interface is a device that facilitates the input and output of
audio signals to and from a computer, typically connected by USB. Almost
all computers come with a basic audio interface built in, but a higher
quality audio interface with at least 4 output channels is recommended for
Mixxx.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-balance">balance</dt><dd><p>A balance control on a mixer allows you to adjust the balance between the
left and right channel. The balance refers to the relative volume of the
corresponding channel in a stereo audio signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-bar">bar</dt><dd><p>In musical notation, a bar (or measure) is a segment of time defined by a
given number of beats. Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the
same length.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-beatgrid">beatgrid</dt><dd><p>A series of markers that point to the location of beats within the track.
Beatgrids are used for advanced mixing functions such as track
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-sync"><span class="xref std std-term">sync</span></a>, precise effects synchronization, looping and accurate
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-BPM"><span class="xref std std-term">BPM</span></a> representation.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-beatmatching">beatmatching</dt><dd><p>A mixing technique used to establish a similar tempo with two or more tracks,
making them sound like just one track.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-binaries">binaries</dt><dd><p>Files that contain compiled computer code, which was compiled from source
code. Source code, which is usually a bunch of text files, is processed
with a program called a compiler. The compiler then generates a binary,
which is something like an an .exe or a .dll file. By using binaries you
are relieved of the task of having to compile the code by yourself.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-bitrate">bitrate</dt><dd><p>Describe the quality of an audio or video file. For audio data the bitrate
is commonly measured in <a class="reference internal" href="#term-kbps"><span class="xref std std-term">Kbps</span></a>. For example, an MP3 audio file that
is compressed at 192 Kbps will have a greater dynamic range and may sound
slightly more clear than the same audio file compressed at 128 Kbps.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-BPM">BPM</dt><dd><p>Beats per minute (BPM) is used as a measure of tempo in music.
If you tap your foot to music you are following the “beat”.
If you count how many taps you do in a minute you have calculated the BPM.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-bug-report">bug report</dt><dd><p>Every software has bugs. When you come across a bug in this software, you
should submit a report about it to the developers. They can use this to
identify, replicate and fix the issue.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-CDJ">CDJ</dt><dd><p>CDJ is a term originally used to describe a line of CD players from Pioneer
Electronics. Today CDJ generally refers to DJ CD players that work like a
record player. They allow analog control of music using CDs, usually using
a touch sensitive emulated vinyl control surface.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-codec">codec</dt><dd><p>Short for compressor/decompressor, a codec is any technology for
compressing and decompressing audio and video data. Some popular
codecs for computer audio include <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MP3"><span class="xref std std-term">MP3</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-Ogg-Vorbis"><span class="xref std std-term">Ogg Vorbis</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-controller">controller</dt><dd><p>An external hardware device that generates and transmits signals to a
computer, usually via USB, to control software with physical controls
other than a mouse and keyboard. Controllers have many uses for music such
as controlling DJ programs like Mixxx. They typically send <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MIDI"><span class="xref std std-term">MIDI</span></a>
signals but some controllers use <a class="reference internal" href="#term-HID"><span class="xref std std-term">HID</span></a> signals. Many DJs prefer to
control DJ software using physical knobs, faders, and wheels on controllers
instead of using a computer keyboard and mouse.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-crossfader">crossfader</dt><dd><p>The crossfader is a slider that determines how much each deck of audio
contributes to the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-master-output"><span class="xref std std-term">master output</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-cue">cue</dt><dd><p>A Cue or Cue point is a reference point in the track usually placed on the
position the DJ wants the track to start at by default. This is useful to
instantly jump to that point without seeking through the track.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-cue-sheet">cue sheet</dt><dd><p>A cue sheet (or CUE file, CUE sheet, etc.) is a formatted plain text file
which is used to provide index information for a large audio file. For
example, it can be used to tell software extra details about the layout of
a CD to burn.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-cueing">cueing</dt><dd><p>Headphone cueing, or just cueing, is listening to the next track you would
like to mix in your headphones. The audience will not hear what you are
cueing in your headphones. Being able to cue is a crucial aspect to DJing.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-DAW">DAW</dt><dd><p>A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or application
software used for recording, editing and producing audio files.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-db">db</dt><dd><p>Short for decibels. A Decibel is a logarithmic measurement of sound
level. Whispering is around 25 dB while unbearable sound such as a jet
engine is around 160 db. Rule of thumb: A volume increase of 10 dB is
perceived as twice as loud.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-deck">deck</dt><dd><p>A deck is like a virtual vinyl turntable. You can load a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-track"><span class="xref std std-term">track</span></a> into
it and play the track, just like you would put a record on turntable and
play it.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-direct-monitoring">direct monitoring</dt><dd><p>A feature of many <a class="reference internal" href="#term-soundcards"><span class="xref std std-term">soundcards</span></a> that allows microphones and other
input signals to be heard through the soundcard outputs with no
perceivable latency. With direct monitoring, the audio interface mixes the
input signal in hardware with the output signal from Mixxx. This
bypasses the latency of sending the signal into the computer for Mixxx to
process and sending it back out to the soundcard.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-DRM">DRM</dt><dd><p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies attempt to control what you
can and can’t do with the media and hardware you’ve purchased. Typically, a
DRM system either encrypts the data so that it can only be accessed in a
way authorized by copyright holders or marks content with a digital
watermark or similar method so that the content can not be freely
distributed. For information about how you can get involved in activism
against DRM, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org">Defective by Design</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-EQ">EQ</dt><dt id="term-Equalizer">Equalizer</dt><dd><p>An equalizer allows the sound in specified frequency bands to be amplified
or reduced, in order to adjust the quality and character of the sound.</p>
<p>A simple graphic equalizer consists of multiple controls for boosting or
cutting bands or frequencies of sound.</p>
<p>A parametric equalizer controls more parameters of the sound than a graphic
equalizer. It can control three aspects of each frequency: level (boost or
cut), the center or primary frequency, and the bandwidth or range of each
frequency.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-fast-forward">fast-forward</dt><dd><p>To cause something to advance at quicker than normal speed. In
terms of audio software that means if you press the fast-forward button
the audio will play with increased speed as long as the button is pressed.
This is useful to seek through a track.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-fast-rewind">fast-rewind</dt><dd><p>The opposite of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-fast-forward"><span class="xref std std-term">fast-forward</span></a>. If you press the fast-rewind button
the audio will play in reverse with increased speed as long as the button
is pressed.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-file-manager">file manager</dt><dd><p>A computer program that organizes data files into groups and shows you
where they are when you need to find them again. Popular file managers for
the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-operating-system"><span class="xref std std-term">operating systems</span></a> Mixxx supports are
Explorer on Windows, Finder on macOS and Nautilus on GNU/Linux.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-FLAC">FLAC</dt><dd><p>Free Lossless Audio Compression (FLAC), a patent-free audio compression
similar to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MP3"><span class="xref std std-term">MP3</span></a> but <a class="reference internal" href="#term-lossless"><span class="xref std std-term">lossless</span></a> (i.e. there is no loss in audio
quality when used). FLAC files generally end with a .flac extension.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-flanger">flanger</dt><dd><p>A flanger is an effect that mixes the input signal with a delayed copy of
itself which leads to interferences in the signal and creates a comb-filter
effect. By routing the output of the effect back into the input (feedback),
the effect is enhanced.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-GUI">GUI</dt><dd><p>Short for “Graphical User Interface” and is pronounced “gooey”. It refers
to a user interface based on graphics (icons, pictures and menus) instead
of text. In Mixxx, it uses a mouse, keyboard, or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-MIDI"><span class="xref std std-term">MIDI</span></a> / <a class="reference internal" href="#term-HID"><span class="xref std std-term">HID</span></a>
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-controller"><span class="xref std std-term">controllers</span></a> as input devices.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-head-mix-button">head/mix button</dt><dd><p>The head/mix button is used to control how much you mix the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-master-output"><span class="xref std std-term">master
output</span></a> into your <a class="reference internal" href="#term-headphone-output"><span class="xref std std-term">headphone output</span></a>. This can be very useful when
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-cueing"><span class="xref std std-term">cueing</span></a> a track, because you can test out how it sounds when mixed
with the main mix in your headphones, before letting the audience hear the
track.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-headphone-button">headphone button</dt><dd><p>The headphone button is used to indicate whether or not you are
pre-listening to a deck or sampler in your headphones.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-headphone-output">headphone output</dt><dd><p>The headphone output is what you hear in your headphones.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-HID">HID</dt><dd><p>Short for Human Interface Device, a part of the USB specification. It
specifies a device class (a type of computer hardware) for human interface
devices such as keyboards, mice, game controllers, and some DJ
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-controller"><span class="xref std std-term">controllers</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-hotcue">hotcue</dt><dd><p>Similar to the main <a class="reference internal" href="#term-cue"><span class="xref std std-term">cue</span></a> point, a hotcue is a reference point in the
track. DJs usually place hotcues at distinctive positions within a track
such as drops, breaks or kicks and snares. Mixxx supports up to 36 hotcues.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-HSV">HSV</dt><dd><p>HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value, and is also often called HSB
(B for brightness). The HSV Color Model represents color in a way more
suited to the human perception of color. For example, the relationships
“stronger than”, “darker than”, and “the opposite of” are easily expressed
in HSV. In contrast, the representation of the hardware-oriented <a class="reference internal" href="#term-RGB"><span class="xref std std-term">RGB</span></a>
model is close to what most monitors show.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-icecast">icecast</dt><dd><p>Icecast is free and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-open-source"><span class="xref std std-term">open-source</span></a> software that allows digital audio
content to be broadcast to and from media player software, enabling the
creation of Internet radio stations. Unlike <a class="reference internal" href="#term-shoutcast"><span class="xref std std-term">Shoutcast</span></a>,
the software provides the ability to stream in free file formats like
