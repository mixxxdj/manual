Gemini G4V
=====================

The Gemini G4V is a 2 deck controller that supports 4 virtual decks, a 4 way mixer and has a built-in 4 channel USB soundcard.
It includes a Microphone input line, an Aux input line and an Booth output line. This lines are not going through the soundcard but mixed directly at the controller.
They are not accessible nor controlled by Mixx so they will not appear in any recording nor is possible to control them via the Mixxx screen interface.

Performance Pads
----------------

Above the wheel on each deck is a set of 8 performance pads (top pads numbered 1-4 and bottom pads numbered 5-8 for the remainder of this manual page).

The functionality of the performance pads is determined by the pads mode: Hot Cue, Auto Loop, Sample, Loop Roll, manual Loop and Beat Jump.

You can can change the mode by using the mode buttons as indicated.

Hot Cue Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Hot Cue mode, press the :hwlabel:`HOT CUE` button.
When the performance pads are in Hot Cue mode, the Hot Cue button will be lit up.

Pressing a performance pad when in Hot Cue mode will control the corresponding numbered Hot Cue (Pad 1 controls Hot Cue 1, etc) on the virtual deck.
If the corresponding Hot Cue isn't set, pressing the performance pad will set a hot cue at that point.
If the corresponding Hot Cue is set, pressing the performance pad will move playback to that hot cue.
If a hot cue is set and it's corresponding performance pad is pressed while the deck's Shift button is being held, the hot cue will be deleted.

Sample Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Sample mode, press the :hwlabel:`SAMPLE` button.
When the performance pads are in Sample mode, the Sample button will be lit up.
It will show the sample decks if the skin has support for them.

Pads will be lit up if they have a track loaded.
Each deck control 8 samples, deck 1 controls samples 1 to 8, deck 2 controls samples 9 to 16, an so on.

The :hwlabel:`SAMPLE VOL` knobs control the volume for all the samples.

Auto Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable looping mode, press the :hwlabel:`AUTO LOOP` button.
When the performance pads are in Auto Loop mode, the Auto Loop button will be lit up.

Pressing a pad starts a loop of the length indicated in the pad, the pad will lit up.
Pressing the lit pad stop the loop.
Pressing a different pad will stop the current loop and start a new one.

The :hwlabel:`LOOP MOVE` knob shifts the loop position in the track.

Loop Roll Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable loop roll mode, press the :hwlabel:`LOOP ROLL` button.
When the performance pads are in Loop Roll mode, the Loop Roll button will be lit up

Pressing a pad start a loop of the length indicated in the pad, the pad will lit up.
Releasing the pad will end the loop and the track position will move to the position it will have been if the loop never happened.

The :hwlabel:`LOOP MOVE` knob shifts the loop position in the virtual deck.

Manual Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Manual Loop mode, press the :hwlabel:`LOOP ROLL` button while holding the :hwlabel:`Shift` button.
When the performance pads are in Manual Loop mode, the :hwlabel:`LOOP ROLL` button will flash.

When a manual loop is set, all 8 performance pads are lit.

================ ===========================================================================
Pad                Function
================ ===========================================================================
pad 1             Sets the loop in point.

pad 2             Sets the loop out point.

pad 3             Enables and disables the loop once the in and out points are set.

pad 5             Doubles the length of the loop.

pad 6             Halves the length of the loop.

pad 7             Moves the loop 1 beat backward.

pad 8             Moves the loop 1 beat forward.
================ ===========================================================================

Beat Jump Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Beat Jump mode, press the :hwlabel:`SAMPLE`  button while holding the :hwlabel:`SHIFT` button.
When the performance pads are in Beat Jump mode, the :hwlabel:`SAMPLE` button will flash

Pressing a pad jumps forward the number of beats indicated in the pad.

Pressing a pad while holding the :hwlabel:`SHIFT` button jumps backward the number of beats indicated in the pad.
