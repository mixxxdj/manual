**Easy customization:** We have provided the following customization variables
at the top of the script you can set to your liking:

1. **faderStart**: If set to *true*, it allows decks to start when their channel
   or the cross-fader is opened. (This is also toggleable with the topmost
   button on the controller. See below.)
2. **scratchFactor**: Adjusts the speed of scratching with the select knob.
   (Defaults to **2**.)

Just open the ``controllers/Stanton-SCS1m-scripts.js`` file in your favorite
text editor (Wordpad works too) and you’ll see these variables right near the
top. Edit & save.
