The left side of the controller controls deck 1. The right side is for deck 2.
This l’ll walk through the controller from top to bottom and explain the
features.

Deck select buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are used only as modifier buttons in Mixxx for now. Hold them down to
access different functions for that side of the controller (Deck A/C for the
left side virtual deck 1, Deck B/D for the right side, deck 2,) detailed for
each control below.

Top horizontal sliders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These adjust the pitch control.

-  Touching near the edges will do a temporary pitch bend in that direction.
-  Hold the current mode button down (EQ/FX) and touch the slider on that side
   to reset it to 0%.
-  Hold the applicable Deck select button down when using these sliders to
   perform fine-grained pitch adjustment.

When the Master button is held down:

-  The left slider adjusts the Pre/Main headphone mix
-  The right slider adjusts main balance
-  Also hold the current mode button and touch the slider on that side to reset
   it to center

FX/EQ sliders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From left to right, for each side:

-  in EQ mode these adjust Low, Mid, and High frequency filters
-  in FX mode these adjust Depth, Delay, and LFO for the flanging effect

Hold down the current mode button (FX/EQ) and touch one of these sliders to
reset it to center.

FX/EQ mode buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press these to choose what the sliders above them control. (See above.)

-  Hold Deck and press FX to toggle the flange effect for that deck
-  Hold Deck and press EQ to auto-adjust the pitch to sync the BPM on this deck
   with the other one (assuming it was detected correctly on both)

Volume sliders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These adjust the channel volume as on a traditional mixer.

-  Holding Deck causes these to adjust the pre-fader gain for the deck

When the Master button is held down:

-  The left slider adjusts the headphone volume
-  The right slider adjusts main volume

Soft buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From top to bottom on both sides:

-  Rewind
-  Fast forward
-  Cue
-  Play

Headphone buttons toggle that deck in the headphone mix.

Cross-fader
~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjusts the cross-fade between the virtual decks

-  Needle drop function: Hold a Deck button to use the cross-fader strip to
   search through the track loaded on that deck

Level Meters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These normally show the pre-fader signal for the respective deck. When holding
down the Master button, they show the stereo main output meters: left side for
the left channel, right side for the right channel.

**NOTE:** The LEDs are calibrated to the VU meters on-screen. If you see a red
LED flicker, *you are clipping* and need to reduce the volume or gain to avoid
distorted sound and/or speaker damage.

Deck switching buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When touching the “A C” or “B D” buttons, the mixer switches between decks. On
the left side, touching “A C” will switch between decks 1 and 3. On the right
side, touching “B D” will switch between decks 2 and 4. All controls except for
the crossfader then control the selected deck.

Connected SCS.3d modules will follow deck changes. For example if you switch
from deck 1 to deck 3 on a SCS.3m, all connected SCS.3d modules who are on deck
1 will also switch to deck 3.

EQ mode
~~~~~~~

This is the standard mixing mode where the three EQ sliders control
low/mid/high. The top slider controls the filter knob.

Touching EQ will return to EQ mode from the FX modes. Holding EQ and touching a
slider will reset it to its preset position. (Unfortunately this doesn’t work
for FX and MASTER modes.)

FX modes
~~~~~~~~

Touch one of the four buttons to the side of the gain slider to control one of
the effect chains. Top button selects first effect chain and so forth. In this
mode, the vertical sliders control the first three knobs of the first effect in
the selected effect chain. The top slider controls dry/wet mix.

You can assign FX chains to the deck by holding FX and pressing one of the four
buttons next to the gain slider. So to assign FX chain 1 to the current deck,
hold FX and press the top button (right below EQ).

When holding FX, the volume slider can be used to adjust channel gain. Hold FX
and slide up to make the channel louder. Hold FX-EQ and touch the gain slider to
reset gain.

MASTER mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

When holding the central MASTER button, the left side controls the headphone
channel, while the right side controls the main channel.

-  Left top slider: Pre/main mix on headphone
-  Right top slider: main balance
-  Left slider: head gain
-  Right slider: main gain
-  Buttons: The buttons assign effects to head and main output
