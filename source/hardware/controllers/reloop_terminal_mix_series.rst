The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 use the same mapping in Mixxx.

.. versionadded:: 1.11

Sound hardware
--------------

The Reloop Terminal Mix 2 and Terminal Mix 4 have integrated multichannel sound cards.
Usually, the TerminalMix runs very well with USB power only.
If you experience issues especially when powering both main and booth outputs at high levels you should use the additional power supply (6v/1.5A).
The official manual from Reloop states not to operate the unit at temperatures below 5°C/41°F as it might damage A/D converters and other components.
However, the audio output may already start crackling if the temperature drops below 10°C.

Inputs
~~~~~~

Both TerminalMix 2 and 4 have a microphone and a switchable line/phono input that can be routed into Mixxx.
The Microphone jack is at the front side of the controller, the RCA line jacks are at the back next to the line/phono switch.
For both inputs there is a gain knob and a switch on the controller’s front side that toggles between routing the signal to the computer (:hwlabel:`SW`) or mixing it directly with the main output (:hwlabel:`MST`).
:hwlabel:`MST` allows to play music from external sources without any software, for example while setting up Mixxx software.
Switch to :hwlabel:`SW` if you want to use the line signal for vinyl control or AUX input, or if you want to record the microphone input with Mixxx, broadcast it, or put on effects.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

At the front, there are two headphone jacks (1/8" and 1/4“), both affected by the hard-wired :hwlabel:`TONE` knob.
At the back, there are unbalanced outputs for booth and main (RCA), as well as a balanced main output (1/4”).
The output level of both main outputs, booth and headphone outputs are all controlled by respective hard-wired knobs in the center column which can’t be mapped to software.

Controller hardware / Maintenance
---------------------------------

The jog wheels’ touch sensitivity can be adjusted separately.
Refer to the `official manual <http://www.reloop.com/media/custom/upload/Reloop-TM4_Factory+JogReset.pdf>`__ for instructions.

When used in dusty environment for a while you might find the MIDI LED flickering although you didn’t touch any of the controls.
This is mostly due to dust/fuzz particles in the ‘comb’ at the jog wheels’ underside that is distracting the IR light barriers that detect platter movement.
Remove the particles with a vacuum cleaner, or blow into the gap between wheel and housing.

After a few years of heavy usage the buttons and sliders may start to wear out.
Then, buttons need to be pressed harder or in a different manner than what was working before, and sliders may send false values when they are actually in the ‘off zone’.
Luckily, the buttons are standard parts and relatively easy to replace, and the sliders’ conductive surface can be cleaned with Q-tips and alcohol.

Mapping options
---------------

The mapping the following customization variable at the top of the script
you can set to your liking:

- ``pitchRanges``: Set the pitch slider range each time you toggle it.

Just open the :file:`Reloop Terminal Mix 2-4.js` file in your favorite
text editor and you’ll see these variables right near the top. Edit and save and
Mixxx will automatically reload the mapping.


Deck controls
-------------

*The controls are the same on both sides of the controller. The left side
controls Deck 1 or 3 and the right side controls Deck 2 or 4.*

- :hwlabel:`3` / :hwlabel:`4` button - When lit all deck buttons (except FX controls) control deck 3 (deck 4 respectively).

Mixer controls
--------------

Channel strips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*The below controls adjust the specified parameter of the respective virtual
deck.*

- :hwlabel:`GAIN` knob - Adjusts the pre-fader gain
- :hwlabel:`HIGH`/:hwlabel:`MID`/:hwlabel:`LOW` EQ knobs - Adjust the volume of the respective frequency range

- :hwlabel:`PHONES` knob - Adjust the headphone output volume of the internal sound card. *(Hard-wired knob, does not send MIDI messages)*
- :hwlabel:`CUE MIX` knob - Adjust how much of the headphone bus vs the main output you hear in the headphones.
- :hwlabel:`SAMPLER VOLUME` knob - Adjusts the volume of all of the samplers at once.
- :hwlabel:`CRATES` button - Does nothing at the moment. (Mixxx’s library doesn’t yet support direct panel selection.) Use the MIDI Learning Wizard to assign an action.*
- :hwlabel:`VIEW` button - Does nothing at the moment. Use the MIDI Learning Wizard to assign an action.* - :hwlabel:`PREP` button - *Does nothing at the moment. Use the MIDI Learning Wizard to assign an action.*

- :hwlabel:`Volume Level Meter`

  - LEDs display the hardware (!) volume of the main output (2 blue LEDs at the top indicate clipping)
  - *Attention:* the main volume might already clip in Mixxx before the hardware LEDs light up. You can adjust the hardware main volume knob and target loudness in :menuselection:`Preferences --> Normalization --> ReplayGain` to keep enough headroom for the main volume in Mixxx and make the lower blue LEDs light up when the main volume clips in Mixxx

- :hwlabel:`POWER` LED (red)
- :hwlabel:`MIDI` LED (blue)

  - Flashes when a MIDI messages was sent

Cross-fader section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move the cross-fader to smoothly fade between the decks assigned to either side.

Deck assign switches (Terminal Mix 4 only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the four switches on the front of the unit to choose on which side of the
cross fader that deck will be heard. (Note that the fader-start functionality
correctly follows this assignment.) If “thru” is selected, the cross-fader
will not affect the audio from that deck and it will always be heard.

Curve adjust
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the knob to adjust the curve from a smooth fade to a fast cut.

*The remaining controls on the front of the unit adjust hardware parameters and
are not MIDI-mappable.*
