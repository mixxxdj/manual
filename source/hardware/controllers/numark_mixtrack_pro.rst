Known problems
--------------

-  The pitch on the controller has a very short run. Thus, having it configured as a +10/-10 (or more) is tricky because you will get a very low pitch precision. Configuring it as +8/-8 (Mk2 style) is
   highly recommended.
-  Each slide/knob needs to be moved on Mixxx startup to match levels with the Mixxx UI.
