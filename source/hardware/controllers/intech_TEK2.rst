   TEK2

.. versionadded:: 2.4.2

TEK2 is a modular controller with 5-point multicolor LED feedback and massive knobs with a two-state switch (pressed & released) in addition to their smooth endless turn. The programmable ‘5-bit display’ indicator can give feedback on centered or starting value positions and highlight parameter states.

Intech Grid modules are modular and fully configurable, allowing you to create your own DJ MIDI controller.

TEK2 and Scratch
----------------

This basic mapping provides jogwheel and scratch functionality in Mixxx.
The row of buttons below the jogwheels is mapped to Play and Cue on each channel.
The buttons in the bottom row are unmapped and can be customized with the Mixxx MIDI mapping wizard.

Setting up the controller
-------------------------

To make this mapping work, follow these steps:

1. Download and open the `Grid Editor <https://intech.studio/ae/products/grid-editor/>`__.
2. In the Grid Editor, access the Profile Cloud where you can load and save configurations to our Modules.
3. Search for 'TEK2 DJ setup', then load and store it to your TEK2.
4. Open up Mixxx, go to :menuselection:`Preferences` --> :menuselection:`Controllers` --> :menuselection:`Intech TEK2` and select the 'Intech TEK2' mapping.

That's it! You are now able to use the jog wheel and create your custom mapping.
