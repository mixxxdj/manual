Firmware
--------

The mapping has been created on Firmware version 1.02

Compatibility
-----------------

The Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 is USB audio and MIDI class compliant and works
with Linux, Windows, and macOS without needing to install any drivers.

Audio Setup
-----------

Configure Mixxx's :ref:`sound hardware settings <preferences-sound-hardware>` as follows:

============ ========
Output       Channel
============ ========
Master       1-2
Headphones   3-4
============ ========

.. note:: It is not possible to record or broadcast input sent from the 1/4" unbalanced
          TS microphone jack on the controller, as it is not routed back to the computer
          and cannot be configured as an input device.

Pad Modes
^^^^^^^^^

The pad mode buttons change between different modes in which the performance pads operate. The main
pad modes described below are similar to those found in rekordbox.

.. note:: The secondary pad modes described in the manufacturer's manual
          (:hwlabel:`KEYBOARD` :hwlabel:`PAD FX1` :hwlabel:`PAD FX2` and
          :hwlabel:`KEYSHIFT`) are not currently implemented by this
          mapping.

Hot Cue Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _pioneer-ddj-flx4-hot-cue-mode:

Bookmark positions in the track and jump to them.

1-8       Pad (lit)                        Jump to hot cue. If the track is stopped, holding the
                                           pad will preview the hot cue until the pad is released.
1-8       :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + Pad (lit)     Clear hot cue.

Beat Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _pioneer-ddj-flx4-beat-loop-mode:

Press a pad to enable a loop from the current position. Press the pad again to
disable the loop. The size of the loop is assigned to the pads as follows:

Beat Jump Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _pioneer-ddj-flx4-beat-jump-mode:

Press a pad to jump forwards or backwards by the number of beats assigned to the
pads below.

Press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad 7 to decrease or :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad 8 to
increase the jump values by a factor of 16.

1-8       :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + Pad (lit)     Stop a loaded sample from playing. If the sample is
                                           already stopped, unload it.
