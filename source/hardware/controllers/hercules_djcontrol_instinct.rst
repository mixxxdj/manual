.. versionadded:: 1.10.1

Setup
-----

The controller is a class compliant MIDI controller, so you should be
able to just plug it in and it should be recognized in Mixxx. No need
for drivers.

Make sure to select the correct mapping for the controller and enable it.

Audio Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two outputs on the controller itself: the headphones output
with builtin volume control on the side facing you and the speakers
output.

In Mixxx the headphones output is on channels 3 and 4, so select the
“Channels 3-4” item to get stereo output. The speakers output is on
channels 1 and 2, so to get stereo output you want to select the
“Channels 1-2” item.
