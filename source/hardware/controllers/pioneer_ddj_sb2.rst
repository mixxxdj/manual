.. versionadded:: 2.0

Audio
-----

The sound card has 2 RCA jacks for the main output. There are two headphone jacks, one small (1/8“) and one large (1/4”) connector (each jack plays the same channels, they cannot be used for
independent signals). There is a 1/4" microphone input with an adjustable gain knob. The microphone input is mixed directly with the main RCA outputs in hardware. It is not available to the computer,
so cannot record or broadcast with the microphone input on the controller. You could use the controller with a separate USB :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` that has a
microphone input for that purpose. The microphone preamplifier is very noisy, so it is recommended to keep the microphone gain knob all the way down when not using a microphone, otherwise there will
be noise added to the main RCA outputs.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Pioneer has a `driver <https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software/ddj-sb2/>`__ for Windows versions 7 and newer. Select the ASIO sound :term:`API` in Mixxx’s Sound Hardware Preferences.

Mac OS X & Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DDJ-SB2 is a USB class compliant :term:`MIDI` and audio device, so it works with Mac OS X and Linux without any special drivers.

User Options
------------

There are some user configurable options for this mapping. To change the options, open the ``.js`` file in your controller for your Pioneer DDJ-SB2 with a text editor such as KWrite or GEdit on GNU/Linux, Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac OS X.

-  **blinkingSync**: If true the sync button blinks with the beat, if false led is lit when sync is enabled.
-  **invertVinylSlipButton**: If true, the vinyl button activates slip. Vinyl mode is then activated by using shift. Allows toggling slip faster, but is counterintuitive.
-  **jogwheelSensivity**: Sets the jogwheels sensitivity. 1 is default, 2 is twice as sensitive, 0.5 is half as sensitive.
-  **jogwheelShiftMultiplier**: Sets how much more sensitive the jogwheels get when holding shift. Set to 1 to disable jogwheel sensitivity increase when holding shift.
-  **speedRateToNormalTime**: Time per step (in ms) for pitch speed fade to normal
-  **showVumeterMaster**: If true Level-Meter shows VU-Master left & right. If false shows level of channel: 1/3 2/4 (depending active deck)
-  **cutVumeter**: Cut’s Level-Meter low and expand upper. Fore example, at 0.5 only signals greater 50% show on the meter, expanded to full range
-  **twinkleVumeterAutodjOn**: If true VU-Level twinkle if AutoDJ is ON.
-  **jumpPreviewEnabled**: If true, when releasing the browser knob, the preview deck jumps forward to “position”.
-  **jumpPreviewPosition**: The place in the track to jump to, on a scale from 0 (beginning of track) to 1 (end of track).

Usage
-----

Library browsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The controls for library browsing can be found in the center top of the controller.

======================================== ==================================================================
Control                                  Function
======================================== ==================================================================
Rotary knob                              Track selection
Load buttons                             Loads currently highlighted track to the corresponding deck
Pushing rotary knob                      Loads currently highlighted track to the preview deck and plays it
Pushing rotary knob again without rotate Stop the preview deck
Shift + rotary knob                      Library section selection (scroll through left pane of library)
Shift + pushing rotary knob              Toggle expanding library section
======================================== ==================================================================

Pushing the rotary knob to start playing a track in the preview deck then releasing it jumps forward in the preview deck. This behavior can be disabled in the mapping’s user options and the place in
the track it jumps to can also be configured.

Addition functions not belonging to library:

-  Shift & load left -> toggle effects view in/out
-  Shift & load right -> toggle sampler view in/out

Switching between decks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press the deck button. It lights when deck 3-4 is active.

Volume, equalizers & filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Between the decks the usual faders, crossfader and EQ knobs can be found. A filter knob is also available.

Knobs are available for the master and headphones level. These control the controller’s built in sound card; they do not control the software gains in Mixxx, so moving them does not move the master
and headphone gain knobs on screen.

The filter fade button changes the crossfader from fading the volumes between decks to using filters to fade between decks.

The TRIM knob controls the deck’s gain.

Jogwheels, tempo & vinyl mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a deck is paused, the jogwheel allows you to browse through a track. If you want to browse faster, hold shift while using the jogwheel.

When a deck is playing, using the jogwheel allows you to temporarily change the tempo of the playing track. Again, holding shift exaggerates this effect.

The tempo slider allows changing the tempo of each deck. This normally changes the pitch of a track, but you can make the pitch stay constant by pressing the “key lock / tempo range” button.
Additionally, with shift, the “key lock / tempo range” will fade the tempo slowly to 0. The fading speed can be customized with the speedRateToNormalTime mapping option.

Vinyl mode makes the jogwheels emulate the way turntables work. Vinyl mode can be toggled by pressing the “vinyl / slip” button. Touching the outer plastic ring of the jogwheel will temporarily change
the tempo like when vinyl mode is off. Touching the metal disc simulates touching the vinyl record, so just putting your hand on it will stop the “vinyl”. You can scratch in a similar way as with
turntables in vinyl mode.

Slip mode
~~~~~~~~~

By pressing shift + “vinyl / slip” you can toggle slip mode. When entering slip mode, Mixxx remembers what point exactly of the track should be playing even if, for example, you scratch or make a
loop. When you press shift + slip again, Mixxx will jump back to that point.

Pads - lower row
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The play and cue pads should be self-explaining. The sync pad toggles master sync for a deck, which tries to beatmatch the deck with the others, and also syncs the tempo between them, even when the tempo of one deck is changed.

Additional functions can be accessed by holding shift

============ ======================================================================================================================
Control      Function
============ ======================================================================================================================
Shift + play Plays the track in reverse and enables slipping (see slip mode)
Shift + cue  Brakes the track as if the power of the motor on a turntable was turned off
Shift + sync Enables quantize mode (this makes most actions, e.g. pressing play or setting the cue point, fall to the nearest beat)
============ ======================================================================================================================

Pads - hot cue mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In hot cue mode the upper row of pads control the hotcues. Pressing a pad that is not lit sets a hotcue. Pressing a pad that is lit makes the track jump and play from that hotcue. Pressing a pad while
holding shift deletes that hotcue.

You can control a set of 4 more hotcues by pressing shift + hot cue. The hot cue button will start blinking. The pads will behave in the same way, but controlling hotcues 5 to 8.

Pads - auto loop mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pressing the pads in auto loop mode will make loops of a specific length measured in beats.

============= ===============================================================================================================
Control       Function
============= ===============================================================================================================
Pad 1         set a loop of the selected number of beats
Pad 2         halve the selected loop length
Pad 3         double the selected loop length
Pad 4         reloop (reactivate a pre-existing loop)
Shift + pad 1 set a rolling loop of the selected number of beats
Shift + pad 2 beatjump backwards by the beatjump size, or move the loop backwards by the beatjump size if the loop is enabled
Shift + pad 3 beatjump forwards by the beatjump size, or move the loop forwards by the beatjump size if the loop is enabled
Shift + pad 4 enable loop, jump to loop in marker, and stop playback
============= ===============================================================================================================

Pads - manual loop mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mode allows you to set loops different from the fixed lengths of beats in auto loop mode.

============= ===========================
Control       Function
============= ===========================
Pad 1         Set loop in
Pad 2         Set loop out
Pad 3         Toggles loop
Pad 4         Halve loop length
Shift + pad 4 Double loop length
Shift + pad 1 Move loop one beat backward
Shift + pad 2 Move loop one beat forward
============= ===========================

Pads - sampler mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In sampler mode the sampler can be controlled. To load a file into a sampler, first press the sampler button while holding shift, so that the sampler button starts blinking. Now pressing a pad will
load the currently highlighted track on the library into the corresponding sampler. Pressing a pad while holding shift will eject the sample.

To play samples, press the sampler button without holding shift (it should not blink). Pressing a pad will start playing the corresponding sample, pressing a pad while holding shift will stop it.

Pads - loop roll (shift + auto loop)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By pressing the auto loop button while holding shift (it should start blinking) you can make loop rolls. This mode combines auto loops with slip mode. The pads will start a loop in the current
position with a determinate beat length while simultaneously enabling slip mode, so that when releasing the pad the track will continue playing as if the loop never happened.

============= =====================
Control       Function
============= =====================
Pad 1         1/16th beat loop roll
Pad 2         1/8th beat loop roll
Pad 3         1/4th beat loop roll
Pad 4         1/2 beat loop roll
Shift + pad 1 1 beat loop roll
Shift + pad 2 2 beat loop roll
Shift + pad 3 4 beat loop roll
Shift + pad 4 8 beat loop roll
============= =====================

Pads - kill (shift + manual loop)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By pressing the manual loop button while holding shift (it should start blinking) you can make the pads behave as EQ kill switches.

======= =========
Control Function
======= =========
Pad 1   Kill low
Pad 2   Kill mid
Pad 3   Kill high
Pad 4   Mute
======= =========

Effects
~~~~~~~

The knob controls the dry/wet knob of the whole effect chain when no effect is focused. When an effect is focused, the knob controls the metaknob of the focused effect. Focus an effect by pressing one
of the effect buttons. To switch the controller’s knob back to manipulating the dry/wet knob, unfocus by pressing the button of the focused effect again.

Press and hold an effect button to toggle the enable switch for that effect. The enable switches for each effect are not shown on the controller’s LEDs, so you need to look at the screen to check
whether an effect is on. All effects are off when Mixxx starts.

Use shift and the mixer knobs to control the parameters of the focused effect. The trim knob controls parameter 1, the equalizer knobs control parameters 2-4, and the filter knob controls parameter 5.

The DDJ-SB2 does not have enough buttons to control assigning effect units to different decks.
You may want to set up a :ref:`custom keyboard mapping <advanced-keyboard>` to have easy access to those switches.
Otherwise, you can use your mouse to click the buttons on screen.

Auto DJ
~~~~~~~

Start/stop Auto DJ: Shift + DECK 4. If enabled in the user options enabled, the level meter LEDs twinkle.

Skip Track: Shift + DECK 3

Channel fader start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By moving a channel fader up from the very bottom while holding shift when a deck is paused, the deck will start playing. Moving the fader back to the bottom without releasing shift stops the deck and
moves it back to its original position.
