   | Overview
   | The pads are for controlling cue’s, loops, and The Numark Mixtrack
     Platinum FX is a 2 channel (with 4 channel layering) entry level DJ
     controller with an integrated audio interface. The stand out
     feature of the Mixtrack Platinum FX is the LCD displays integrated
     into the jog wheels. It is a USB Audio and MIDI Class compliant
     device and works with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

   Audio Interface

   Configure Mixxxs’ Master output for channels 1-2 and Headphones
   output for Channels 3-4.

   The microphone input on this controller is not available to the
   computer through the controller’s audio interface. It is mixed with
   the master output in hardware, so this controller’s audio interface
   is not suitable for broadcasting or recording the inputs. If you want
   to use the controller for broadcasting or recording, a separatewith a
   microphone input is suggested.

   Advanced User Section

   For advanced users, alternative functions exist in the code, by
   accessing and setting a code

   variable.

   **TAPPING**

   Added logic for the tap button, Two modes exist:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| •                                 |    The default is to use the      |
|                                   |    MIXXX common bpm.tapButton     |
| •                                 |    which sets the effective bpm   |
|                                   |    to the one tapped using the    |
|                                   |    tempo adjust. Shift tap resets |
|                                   |    to 0 tempo change.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |    The alternative changes the    |
|                                   |    actual file bpm. The problem   |
|                                   |    is the reset doesn't work, the |
|                                   |    best I can do is change the    |
|                                   |    effective bpm to the original, |
|                                   |    but then the file is still     |
|                                   |    "broken" next time it is       |
|                                   |    loaded. The alternative mode   |
|                                   |    is only accessible by setting  |
|                                   |    a code variable                |
|                                   |    M                              |
|                                   |MixtrackPlatinumFX.tapChangesTempo |
|                                   |    to false, recommended only for |
|                                   |    advanced users                 |

   For the default, the MIXXX common function takes taps and averages
   them. If you don't tap for 2 seconds the average resets and you start
   again. To prevent accidental double taps or misses if a tap is 40%
   shorter or 80% longer it will be ignored. I found while testing
   sometimes if I got the first two taps wrong the rest would be
   rejected by the filter, but it wasn't obvious this was happening. By
   default the button is dimly lit (like most others). When you tap the
   button if it accepts the tap it will go bright, if it rejects it from
   the filter it will show off. If this happens stop tapping wait 2
   seconds for the filter to clear and try again. Fixed this kicking in
   after 8 taps.

   For tapping we have to "guess" which deck is intended, so we use some
   pointers.

   1.we'll only consider loaded decks

   2.except in fallback we'll only consider decks on the "active" layer
   (unless neither on this layer are loaded)

   3.If one deck has PFL and the other doesn't we use that one
   (assumption that tapping bpm will be on a non playout deck)

   4.If both have the same PFL state then look if one is playing.
   Currently prefers the one that IS playing, could argue this the other
   way?

   5.If they both match then use the one with the lowest deck number

   To help know which it is using when tapping BOTH up and down arrows
   on the deck are lit. As the first tap doesn't make any changes (you
   can't work out a bpm from one tap) it is safe to tap and hold the
   button and check which deck the arrows are showing on.

   MixtrackPlatinumFX.tapChangesTempo to false, recommended only for
   advanced users. The pads are for controlling cue’s, loops, and
   samples via various modes & layers. To select a mode, select a Pad
   Mode button (Cue, Auto Loop, Fader Cuts & Sample) to assign that
   functionality to the 8 pads. An LED under the pad section indicates
   the currently selected

   Further to the Normal Pad Modes, 2 additional layers of
   functionality, SHIFT & ALTERNATE is also provided as shown in matrix
   below.
