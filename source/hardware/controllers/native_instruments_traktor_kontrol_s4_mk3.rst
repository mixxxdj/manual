Native Instruments Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3
=========================================

The Kontrol S4 MK3 is a 4 deck all-in-one controller with a sturdy build quality and integrated sound card.
Compared to the MK2 and MK1, it also has shiny, motorised aluminum jogwheels, screens and a set of pads which can be used for
various features.

The S4 MK3 uses the standard :term:`HID` protocol for the buttons, knobs, faders and LEDs, and extends it for the motorized jogwheels.
The screens use a USB Bulk transfer.
The easiest way to tell the MK3 apart from the MK1 and Mk2 models are these screens, placed in between the "Move" and "Loop" encoders.

Unlike its predecessors, the Kontrol S4 Mk3 cannot run from :term:`USB` power and the separate power supply must be used.

Compatibility
-------------

The Kontrol S4 MK3 is a USB class compliant audio and :term:`HID`, so it is compatible with Mixxx without any proprietary drivers on GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows.

With the S4 plugged in, a HID device is listed as an available controller in Mixxx’s Preferences.
The controller uses HID for each components on the device, except the screens, so the mapping can only be loaded when you select the HID device on the left side of Mixxx’s Preferences.

Controller
-------------

Setup audio output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the S4 mixer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use the audio output of the controller, select the device :guilabel:`Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3`. :guilabel:`Channels 1 - 2` should be set as :guilabel:`Main` and :guilabel:`Channels 3 - 4` should be set as :guilabel:`Headphones`

Using the software mixer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't want to use certain outputs of the device, you can enable the mapping of the mixer knob to the Mixxx internal mixer. Head over to the :ref:`settings` to enable these optional mappings.

   .. note:: The mixer knobs are physically linked to the S4 embedded mixer. This means that there is no way to prevent these buttons to adjust gains of the output, and will lead to unexpected volume mixing if the Mixxx mixer is used while also using S4 outputs.


Known bugs and limitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audio
^^^^^

During the development phase, it appears that using other Sound API than `ALSA` would lead the Master VU meter not to work. Furthermore, audio output power would be half as loud as it should
be, which can be a problem if you are also using other software, since you audio setting will suddenly become twice as loud. It remains unclear whether or not this was a common issue or if
this was specific to the used setup.

Screens
^^^^^^^

The controller screens are supported, but they require a little bit of tinkering. Due to the legacy controller engine, the screen are driven by a separate mapping, which will have to be set
independently of the controller mapping.

   .. note:: The screens rendering is done using QML and the communication is achieved via BULK USB endpoint. Both of these features are not available out of the box on Windows and Mac for now.

By default, the screens are standalone. This means that local state changes such as deck selection or shifting will not trigger any screen interaction,
and thus you should expect only Deck A and B to be displayed on these screen by default, although this can be changed in the controller settings.

   .. note:: It exists an API that was temporarily parked that allows mappings to communicate. If you want, you may `download pre-built binaries <https://github.com/acolombier/mixxx/actions/runs/13751974244?pr=10>` or build a version of Mixxx with `this feature <https://github.com/acolombier/mixxx/pull/10>` and it should automatically work on the controller.

.. _use-motors:

Motors
^^^^^^

Haptic feedback (know as Haptic Drive (TM)) is partially implemented. Supported features include jogwheel tensions and turntable mode, but these features remain in beta and
may sometime have unexpected behaviours. Since there is no guarantee on the long term effect to the controller of how Mixxx implements these features, they are disabled by default.
You can enable them by setting `UseMotors` to `true` in :ref:`settings`.


Mapping Description
-------------------

.. _jogwheel-modes:

Jogwheel modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The jogwheel can be used to control various things, depending on the mode they are in.

1. **Vinyl mode** (*default*): The jogwheel platter can be used for scratch. The jogwheel crown can be used to jog up or down the playback.
2. **Jog mode**: The wheel platter and crown can be used to jog up or down the playback.
3. **Turntable mode**: The wheel behaves as a 33.3 RPM turntable. If the platter or crown are slowed down or speeded up, then it will scratch down or up the track.

   .. warning:: Because this mode relies on Mixxx's scratch mode, if the track has been pitched up, the keylock will be ignored!

   .. note:: This mode is only available if the motor features are enabled. See :ref:`use-motors` for more details.

4. **Loop in**: The wheel behaves similarly to CDJ. If the platter or crown are turned, it will move back or forth the start of the loop. Additionally, if the loop encoder is used, it will move the all loop back or forth.
5. **Loop out**: Like the **Loop in** mode, but for the exit position of the loop. If the platter or crown are turned, it will move the end of the loop back or forth. Additionally, the "Loop" encoder can used in the same way as in **Loop in** mode.

Here is how to tell what mode is on, depending the current state of the LED:

+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Mode           | :hwlabel:`Jog` | :hwlabel:`TT` | Jogwheel LED                                   | Others                                  |
+================+================+===============+================================================+=========================================+
| Vinyl mode     | On             | Off           | Circling while the track is playing/scratching | --                                      |
+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Jog mode       | Off            | Off           | Circling while the track is playing/scratching | --                                      |
+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Turntable mode | Off            | On            | Circling while the track is playing/scratching | --                                      |
+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Loop in mode   | --             | --            | The whole circle is blinking                   | The :hwlabel:`REV` button is blinking   |
+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Loop out mode  | --             | --            | The whole circle is blinking                   | The :hwlabel:`FLX` button is blinking   |
+----------------+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

Here is how to select each mode:

+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mode           |                                                                                             |
+================+=============================================================================================+
| Vinyl mode     | Press the :hwlabel:`Jog` button (while the :hwlabel:`Jog` button is off)                    |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Jog mode       | Press the :hwlabel:`Jog` button while in vinyl mode (while the :hwlabel:`Jog` button is on) |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Turntable mode | Press the :hwlabel:`TT` button. Pressing again while restore the Vinyl mode                 |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Loop in        | Press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`REV` while a loop is enable                              |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Loop out       | Press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`FLX` while a loop is enable                              |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For all modes but :hwlabel:`Vinyl` and :hwlabel:`Jog`, re-selecting the mode will restore the previous one.


Move modes
~~~~~~~~~~

Moves modes define how the "move" encoder (the one on the left) reacts when used. Here are all the various modes:

1. **Beat** (*default*): The track will jump backward or forward by the number of beats selected. Press before turning to select the number of beats.
2. **Grid**: The track's detected beats will be move forward or backward on the waveform.
3. **BPM**: The track's detected BPM will be increased or decreased.
4. **Keyboard**: The keyboard's keys displayed on pads get moved up or down to display higher or lower keynotes.
5. **Hotcue color**: When selecting a hotcue, the move encoder can be used to change the selected color.

   .. note:: When using the shared data API, this will display hotcue metadata such as label (if any), timecode and type.

Here is how to tell use each modes:

+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mode         |                                                                     |
+==============+=====================================================================+
| Beat         | This mode is enable if no other mode are enabled                    |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grid         | This mode is enabled while :hwlabel:`GRID` is held down             |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| BPM          | This mode is enabled while :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`GRID` are   |
|              | held down                                                           |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Keyboard     | This mode is enabled while STEM is held down                        |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Hotcue color | This mode is enabled while HOTCUE is held down                      |

Keep transport and play button dimmed when off                                                 true                                   Having this setting on will keep LED always dimmed, even when off, although they may not have a matching color with the deck's color
Keep the unselected deck button off rather than show its deck color                            true                                   Having this setting on will keep the LED of the unselected deck dimmed instead of off.
Keylock on :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`MASTER` instead of :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`SYNC`  false                                  Use :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`MASTER` to toggle the keylock instead of :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`SYNC`
Make the :hwlabel:`grid` button blink when over a detected beat                                false                                  Make the :hwlabel:`GRID` button blinking when the playback goes over a detected beat
Make the jogwheel ring blink when the track playing is near the end                            true                                   The jogwheel LED ring will start blinking when a track is near the end. The end section can be defined in :menuselection:`Preferences --> Waveforms --> End of track warning`
Use the mixer to control input when using :hwlabel:`SHIFT`                                     false                                  Make the :hwlabel:`GRID` button blinking when the playback goes over a detected beat
Number of samples used for jogwheel speed                                                      3                                      Number of samples used to determine the jogwheel movement. A higher value will increase precision but latency too, and vice-versa
Replace the sampler tab by a beatloop roll tab                                                 false                                  Replace the sample tab as well of the sample feature with 8 beatloop roll
:hwlabel:`FILTER` is first quick effect                                                        false                                  Assign the first quick effect to the :hwlabel:`FILTER` button instead of button :hwlabel:`1`. This option is useful if you are used to Filter being the primary quick effect and have it at the top of your quick effect list.
Define the predefined size to use for the beatjump tab                                         1,2,4,8,16,32,64,beatjump              Define the size of beatjumps of each pad, from left to right, starting from the top row. "beatjump" refers the currently selected value (beatjump_forward or beatjump_backward), "half" and "double" can be used to control this value
Define the predefined size to use for the beatloop tab                                         1/16,1/8,1/4,1/2,1,2,4,8               Define the size of loops of each pad, from left to right, starting from the top row.
Use the two last tab as loop half/double buttons in the beatloop tab                           true                                   Use the last two pad from the bottom row as loop half and loop double. These can be used to interact with beatloop roll and normal loop.
Jogwheel speed (in turntable mode, as well as LED indicator)                                   33 + 1/3                               The turntable mode defines how fast the jogwheel turns (if on) as well as the LED, and the overall jogwheel sensitivity. It is recommended to keep either 33 + 1/3 or 45 as a value
Whether or not to use haptic feedback features                                                 false                                  Whether or not to use haptic feedback features. This is a beta feature, some of them may be unstable.

Map the mixer :hwlabel:`Booth` knob to the Mixxx internal mixer                                false                                  When enabled, the Booth knob will drive the Booth gain of the Mixxx internal mixer as well as the hardware built-in mixer in the device.
Map the mixer headphone knobs  :hwlabel:`VOL` and :hwlabel:`MIX` to the Mixxx internal mixer   false                                  When enabled, the headphone knobs will drive the headphone controls of the Mixxx internal mixer as well as the hardware built-in mixer in the device.
Default Pad Layout                                                                             default                                Define the default layout used for the pads.

Changing settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mixxx 2.4
^^^^^^^^^

Making these changes is still a little awkward, this will be much easier to do starting in Mixxx 2.5.
For now you’ll have to make a small change to the mapping script file. Don’t worry, the actual edit only involves replacing a single word in a text file.

1. Open Mixxx Preferences and select the Kontrol S4 in the side list.
2. Select :file:`Traktor-Kontrol-S4-MK3-hid-scripts.js`.
3. Click :guilabel:`Open Selected File`.
4. Either the file should open in an editor, or you should see a file browser window with that file selected. If you see a file browser, right click the file and select an option to edit it.
5. Starting from the block entitled `USER CONFIGURABLE SETTINGS`, there should be configurable options.



Mixxx 2.5+
^^^^^^^^^^

Settings can be edited in the preference windows, under :guilabel:`Preferences` > :guilabel:`Controllers` > :guilabel:`Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3 ...`.
