Obinslab Anne Pro 2
===================

The Anne Pro 2 is a computer keyboard that can be used wirelessly over Bluetooth
5.0 or wired via USB-C.
It has individually addressable RGB backlights for each key which can be
controlled by Mixxx to provide feedback to the DJ.

The mapping assumes a QWERTY keyboard layout and does not take into account
customized keyboard shortcuts in Mixxx.
The keyboard is a standard HID device and does not require drivers.

Controller Mapping
------------------

Unlike most DJ hardware mappings, this mapping does not change use of the
keyboard itself or affect Mixxx in any way.
Instead, it maps on-screen controls to the LED of the shortcut key for that
control.
Basic shortcuts on the first layer are supported including play pause, cues,
track colors, etc.
If the track ending indicator illuminates for any deck, the space bar LED will
illuminate.
