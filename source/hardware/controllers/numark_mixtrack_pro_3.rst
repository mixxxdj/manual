Numark Mixtrack (Pro) 3
=======================

-  `Manufacturer’s product page <https://www.numark.com/product/mixtrack-pro-3>`__
-  `Manufacturer's User Manual <https://www.numark.com/images/product_downloads/MixtrackPro3-UserGuide-v1.1.pdf>`__
-  `Forum thread <https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/mixtrack-pro-3/15165>`__

The Numark Mixtrack 3 and Numark Mixtrack Pro 3 are the same controller
except that the Pro version has an integrated 4 channel output sound
card and costs $50 more. If you use the non-Pro version, you would need
a :ref:`splitter cable <hardware-splitter-cables>` or
:ref:`separate audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` to be able
to preview tracks in headphones.

The microphone input on the Pro version is not available to the computer
through the controller’s sound card. It is mixed with the main output
in hardware, so this controller’s sound card is not suitable for
broadcasting or recording the inputs. If you want to use the controller
for broadcasting or recording, getting the non-Pro version with a
separate :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` with a
microphone input is suggested.
