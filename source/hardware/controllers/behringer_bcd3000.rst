The B-Control Deejay BCD3000 controller is a 4-channel audio interface.
It offers a fully fitted controller console with 24-bit A/D und D/A converters,
a USB audio interface with a microphone preamplifier,
a 3-band kill EQ for each channel, faders, a crossfader and talkover function.

By default, the input channels 1-2 use the RCA phono inputs for the
source signal. On Windows, this can be switched to the microphone in the
ASIO driver control panel. On GNU/Linux and Mac OS X,
`a particular MIDI message must be sent <https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/mixxx-bcd3000-mic-port-is-not-work/16008>`__
to switch channels 1-2 to the microphone input.
