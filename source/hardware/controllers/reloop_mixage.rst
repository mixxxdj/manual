Reloop Mixage
=============

The Reloop Mixage line of controllers contains 2-channel DJ controller. It offers two jog wheels, line faders, a cross-fader, controls for looping, effects, equalizers and gain controls. The Interface Edition version comes with an integrated soundcard, headphone connection and microphone input and exists in version MK1 (unmarked) and MK2 (marked on back of device)

Audio
-----

This controller is a MIDI and audio class compliant device so it is compatible as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. On Windows, the manufacturer ships an :term:`ASIO` low-latency driver that can be found on the `manufacturer’s product
page <productpage_url_>`_.

The microphone :hwlabel:`🎤` input can be set to different modes. To make it usable in Mixxx, set it to **SW**. The :hwlabel:`MASTER` and :hwlabel:`PHONES` level controls work directly on the audio hardware and can't be mapped in Mixxx.

All mapped controls use MIDI channel #1 (can be changed on the back of the device). Most functions on this controller are quite self-explanatory and mapped in that way (you might want to check the official manual too)

The effect buttons and knobs on the left side apply to effect rack 1, the ones on the right to effect rack 2. The numbers from the overview correspond to the product manual and mapping XML file Txx numbers.

Jog wheel
---------

- With :hwlabel:`🔍` button active: Scroll through the track. While touching the top of the wheel scrolling is three times as fast
- With :hwlabel:`💿` button active: Touch the side of the jog wheel to nudge the deck. Touch the top of the jog wheel to scratch (either deck playing or not)
- With the Beatloop adjust mode active: Adjusts the selected loop point

Beatloop adjust mode
--------------------

When a beatloop has been set, press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`-LENGTH+` / :hwlabel:`BEATMOVE` to enable beatloop adjust mode. The :hwlabel:`LOOP` / :hwlabel:`IN` and :hwlabel:`RELOOP` / :hwlabel:`OUT` buttons will blink. Now you can:

- Move the entire loop using the jog wheel, adjustment is three times as fast while the top of the jog wheel is touched.
- Press :hwlabel:`LOOP` / :hwlabel:`IN` to shift the loop in point using the jog wheel. The :hwlabel:`LOOP` / :hwlabel:`IN` will blink
- Press :hwlabel:`RELOOP` / :hwlabel:`OUT` to shift the loop out point using the jog wheel. The :hwlabel:`RELOOP` / :hwlabel:`OUT` will blink

Hold :hwlabel:`SHIFT` and press :hwlabel:`-LENGTH+` / :hwlabel:`BEATMOVE`, or press :hwlabel:`🔍` or :hwlabel:`💿` button to leave betloop adjust mode

User-adjustable script settings
-------------------------------

The `Reloop-Mixage.scripts.js` controller script provides the following settings:

-  Scratch behaviour can be changed to a more regular, turntable-like mode by changing the setting `scratchByWheelTouch` to `true`. Note that the jog wheels are not very sensitive to touch though (sensitivity can be adjusted on the back of the controller in the MK1 version).
-  Scratch speed can be adjusted by changing the setting `scratchTicksPerRevolution`. Smaller values "scratch more" of the track, larger values "scratch less".
-  Jog wheel scroll speed can be adjusted by changing the setting `jogWheelScrollSpeed`. The higher, the faster.

Controller diagnostic functions
-------------------------------

Turn off the controller and hold one of these buttons while turning on the controller:

-  Right :hwlabel:`SHIFT` to display the firmware version on the four deck play/cue buttons. The number is display in little-endian binary, e.g 0101 meaning 5.
-  Right :hwlabel:`⏯` to show jog wheel touch values. This can be used to adjust sensitivity on the MK1 version
-  Left :hwlabel:`⯈⯇` to light up all LEDs. Can be helpful when repairing the controller or replacing the LEDs
