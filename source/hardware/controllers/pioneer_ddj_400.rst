.. versionadded:: 2.3.0

Firmware
--------

.. note:: The release version of the firmware contains a bug which causes
          signals from the tempo sliders to be sent without the sliders being
          touched.

          It is therefore highly recommended that you update your controller's
          firmware.

You can download the latest firmware from
`the manufacturer's website <https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software/controller/ddj-400/>`__.

Unfortunately Pioneer only offers a Windows and Mac firmware installer, so to
update your controller you will need access to such a machine. Simply download
the appropriate file for that OS, attach your device and run the installer.

Compatibility
-----------------

The Pioneer DDJ-400 is USB audio and MIDI class compliant and works
with Linux, Windows, and macOS without needing to install any drivers.
However, updating the firmware is recommended as described above.

Audio Setup
-----------

Configure Mixxx's :ref:`sound hardware settings <preferences-sound-hardware>` as follows:

============ ========
Output       Channel
============ ========
Main         1-2
Headphones   3-4
============ ========

.. note:: It is not possible to record or broadcast input sent from the 1/4" unbalanced
          TS microphone jack on the controller, as it is not routed back to the computer
          and cannot be configured as an input device.

Controller Mapping
------------------

The schematic drawings used here can be referenced in the
`manufacturer's manual <https://support.pioneerdj.com/hc/sections/4416577146009-ddj-400>`__

Pad Modes
^^^^^^^^^

The pad mode buttons change between different modes in which the performance pads operate. The main
pad modes described below are similar to those found in rekordbox.

.. note:: The secondary pad modes described in the manufacturer's manual
          (:hwlabel:`KEYBOARD` :hwlabel:`PAD FX1` :hwlabel:`PAD FX2` and
          :hwlabel:`KEYSHIFT`) are not currently implemented by this
          mapping.

Hot Cue Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _pioneer-ddj-400-hot-cue-mode:

Bookmark positions in the track and jump to them.

1-8       Pad (lit)                        Jump to hot cue. If the track is stopped, holding the
                                           pad will preview the hot cue until the pad is released.
1-8       :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + Pad (lit)     Clear hot cue.
========  ===============================  ========================================================

Beat Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _pioneer-ddj-400-beat-loop-mode:

Press a pad to enable a loop from the current position. Press the pad again to
disable the loop. The size of the loop is assigned to the pads as follows:

.. _pioneer-ddj-400-beat-jump-mode:

Press a pad to jump forwards or backwards by the number of beats assigned to the
pads below.

Press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad 7 to decrease or :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad 8 to
increase the jump values by a factor of 16.

                                           playback starts from the beginning.
1-8       :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + Pad (lit)     Stop a loaded sample from playing. If the sample is
                                           already stopped, unload it.
