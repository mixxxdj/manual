Denon MC7000
============

The Denon MC7000 is a professional DJ controller which has got 4-channel capability and dual USB connections. These two USB audio interfaces enable two DJs to play together. This controller includes Denon’s high build quality and superior 24-bit audio reproduction, makes this suited to both mobile and club DJs.

.. versionadded:: 2.2.4
.. versionchanged:: 2.3.0
   Fixed a vinyl mode bug on deck 4 and added new features, like library sorting, searching through track with jog wheel, ejecting track from deck, waveform zoom, fixed loops and an experimental beat counter (slicer-like) and improved parameter and censor/reverse/spinback button mappings.
.. versionchanged:: 2.3.1
   Some improvements for slip mode, sampler play and rate range toggle. Added browsing through library using jog wheel.

This controller is made for Serato DJ and most of the mapping is made
for Mixxx accordingly. Anyhow, there are several differences for
functions not matching the Serato mapping. If you have any wishes to
improve the mapping, then please discuss it in the `Denon MC7000

| Add samplers to the sampler bank pushing a pad button.
| If a sampler is loaded, then another push on the pad button will play the sampler from its Cue point.
| Push the pad button again while playing will replay the sampler from Cue point.
| When a sampler is started while another one is still playing, then the initial sampler stops and only the newly triggered sampler plays (single play).

Use :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad button to stop a sampler while playing or eject a sampler when stopped.

   To use default Mixxx behaviour and allow playing multiple samplers at the same time you can set the user variable ``MC7000.prevSamplerStop`` inside the :ref:`JavaScript file<denon_mc7000_uservariables>` to ``false``.

Velocity Sampler Mode (purple LED)
----------------------------------

Velocity Sampler Mode is a mode where the velocity of the push on the pad determines the volume of the sampler played.
A gentle push results in low volume and a powerful push restults in high volume.
Apart from that the behavior is equal to Sampler Mode.

As default 16 samplers can be used.
8 samplers can be triggered from Deck 1 and Deck 3 and 8 samplers can be triggered from Deck 2 and Deck 4. Deck 1 will play sampler 1 to 8, Deck 2 will play sampler 9 to 16, Deck 3 will play sampler 1 to 8 and Deck 4 will play sampler 9 to 16.

| Add samplers to the sampler bank pushing a pad button.
| If a sampler is loaded, then another push on the pad button will play the sampler from its Cue point.
| Push the pad button again while playing will replay the sampler from Cue point.
| When a sampler is started while another one is still playing, then the initial sampler stops and only the newly triggered sampler plays (single play).

Use :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + pad button to stop a sampler while playing or eject a sampler when stopped.

Pitch Play Mode (green LED)
---------------------------

Pitch Play Mode is a mode where the pad position determines the pitch of the deck played.
After activating the Pitch, the pads light up in hotcue colors, waiting for a selection of existing hotcue for Pitch Play or creating a new hotcue at the current position.
When a hotcue has been selected or created, this hotcue is used for Pitch Play.

During Pitch Play the range of pitch can be changed up or down using the param buttons.

| start Pitch Play pushing a pad button after hotcue selection.
| If the deck is playing, then another push on the pad button will start to play the deck with the assigned pitch from its Cue point.
| To reset pitch press shift and pad button.

LEDs
~~~~

The Channel Volume Meters matches to the ones shown in Mixxx GUI. Only when clipping the red LED illuminates.

The :hwlabel:`MASTER LEVEL` meter is not correlated to Mixxx GUI as the controller handles that in Hardware.

Button LEDs are fully mapped for the first function. As you press and hold :hwlabel:`SHIFT` then the secondary functions have only got some flashing LEDs mapped, e.g. TAP and KEY SYNC, when activated.

Press :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`Deck` to switch Platter Ring LED Mode.

  - Mode 0 - Single 'off' LED chase (all other LEDs are 'on')
  - Mode 1 - Single 'on' LED chase (all other LEDs are 'off')

.. hint::
   The default mode can be set to ``0`` or ``1`` inside the :ref:`JavaScript file<denon_mc7000_uservariables>`.


Platter Ring LEDs are correlated with the :hwlabel:`VINYL` button.

  - If vinyl mode is enabled, the LED imitates a turntable platter spinning at 33.3 rpm.
  - If vinyl mode is disabled, the current track position is indicated by the Platter LEDs starting at the top.

.. note::
  The Platter Ring LEDs are not moving while the track position is 'negative'. That means if the position is before the track starts then the position LED keeps staying at most up position.


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Some Performance Pad modes are not available (Cue Loop, Flip, Slicer Loop).
- The Effect Units don't use Mixxx' Standard Effects Mapping
