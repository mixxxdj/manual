Vestax VCI-300
==============

The VCI-300 is a dedicated USB MIDI controller. It also comes with a built in audio interface with standard 4-in/4-out and headphone connection, which means all you need for DJing is the VCI-300, a
laptop and a set of headphones.

This controller has been discontinued as Vestax went out of business in 2014.

Differences between VCI-300 and VCI-300 MKII
--------------------------------------------

In 2010 Vestax made changes to the original VCI-300 that improved the controller. There were *no* changes in the MIDI mapping.

Volume Boost (Gain Boost)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Higher output gain level and headphone volume level when supplying power with the optional power adaptor.
-  *Important Note:* Optional power supply DC-7 must be used in order to get the boost on the headphones and main output. Without the power supply the MKII will perform just like the original
   VCI-300. Also, using the DC-7 on the original VCI-300 will do nothing.

Optional Vestax Digital Fader (not included)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The VCI-300MKII Cross fader can be upgraded to Vestax’s new magnetic sensor system digital fader CF-X2.

New Direct Audio Thru
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audio fed to the MIC/AUX input can now be directly sent to the main outputs with the THRU switch turned ON, minimizing latency of when fed through ITCH.

New adjust knobs for the JOG sensor control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New JOG sensor adjust knobs for speedy and accurate adjustments.the VCI-300MKII’s JOG wheels have excellent tracking ability,and flexibility for various play styles.You can control songs with analog
precision.

New Mini Head-Phone Jack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MKII features a 1/8 inch headphone connection along with standard 1/4 inch connection.

Mixxx supports the VCI-300 out of the box. The mapping for Mixxx closely resemble the original to make the transition easy.
