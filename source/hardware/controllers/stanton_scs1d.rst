Mapping description
-------------------

**Easy customization:** We have provided the following customization variables
at the top of the script you can set to your liking:

-  **pitchRanges** - The pitch ranges selectable with the Range button. You can
   add more as you like but they must be in ascending order.
-  **fastDeckChange** - If set to true, changes decks instantly by skipping the
   flashing lights. Useful for beat juggling on one unit.
-  **globalMode** - If true, the unit will stay in the current section modes on
   virtual deck changes (instead of switching to the modes you were in the last
   time you controlled that virtual deck.) The trigger pad section always stays
   in the current mode regardless of this setting.
-  **platterSpeed** - The speed of the platter at 0% pitch: 0=33 RPM, 1=45 RPM
-  **deckChangeWait** - Time in milliseconds to hold the Deck Select button down
   to avoid changing decks
-  **padVelocity** - If set to true, uses the velocity values when recalling
   cues on the trigger pads (this is toggle-able with a button on the unit as
   well.)
-  **crossFader** - If true, uses the pitch slider to adjust the cross-fader
   while the Pitch Range button is held down
-  **browseDamp** - Number of platter ticks to move the highlight one item when
   browsing the library. Set higher for slower movement. (Defaults to 3.)
-  **looseLoops** - If true (default,) causes the loop buttons to set new loop
   points each time you press them (good for loop rolls.) If set to false, you
   must explicitly delete one before you can set another.

Just open the ``midi/Stanton-SCS1d-scripts.js`` file in your favorite text
editor (Wordpad works too) and you’ll see these variables right near the top.
Edit & save, then restart Mixxx and enjoy.

Now let’s take a look at how the controls operate, starting in the upper left
and moving counter-clockwise:

Mode switch buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Setup**\ *: unused by Mixxx but will enter the deck’s internal setup menu*
-  **Control**\ *: unused*
-  **Browse**: Allows browsing the library with the platter. Press additional
   times to change the category (Library, Playlists, Crates, etc.) To go
   backwards, press another mode button (Vinyl or Control) then Browse again.
-  **Vinyl**: Take a guess! :-)
-  **⇒/Enter**: Loads the currently selected track into the currently selected
   virtual deck
-  **Deck Select**: Switches to the other virtual deck
-  **⇐/Cancel**\ *: unused*

Transport section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **circle button**: Toggles headphone cue
-  **«**: Fast rewind
-  **»**: Fast forward
-  **\|«**\ *: unused*
-  **»\|**\ *: unused*
-  **Cue, Sync, Play/Pause**: as labeled
-  **BPM**: BPM tap

Trigger Pad section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trigger pads are used to set and recall hot cues. You can use them as you
would a sampler if the target deck is stopped (where it will only play as long
as you are pressing the pad) or as hot cues (if the target deck is playing.) You
set a cue simply by pressing an unlit pad at the desired point. It lights green
when there’s a cue set and the corresponding display shows the cue point in
``minutes:seconds.centiseconds`` format.

-  **circle buttons**\ *above the displays: unused*
-  **circle button** at the top right of the section:
-  Velocity toggle: When lit red, the target deck’s volume will be adjusted by
   how hard you strike the pads. Press this button to toggle the feature.
-  Delete cues: Hold this button down and press a pad to delete the cue stored
   there
-  **circle buttons** at the bottom right of the section: These select the cue
   bank for each deck. The top button chooses the bank for deck one and the
   bottom for deck two. There are three banks for each deck denoted by the
   button color: green (1), red (2), and amber (3). In this way you can recall
   cues/play samples on either deck at any time regardless of what the rest of
   the controller is doing.

Pitch slider section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Pitch slider**:
-  Pitch adjust: directly corresponds to the slider on screen for the currently
   selected virtual deck. Since the slider is motorized, it will move on its own
   if you change decks or adjust the slider on the screen.
-  Cross-fader adjust: will move to and allow adjustment of the on-screen
   cross-fader while the Range button is held down.
-  **Range button**:
-  Toggles between the pitch range values specified in the **pitchRanges**
   global variable mentioned at the top of this page
-  When held, allows the pitch slider to be used to adjust the cross-fader (if
   the **crossFader** variable is set to true.) If you do this, the pitch range
   will not be changed when you release the button.
-  **Reset button**: Resets the slider to the center position when adjusting
   pitch or the cross-fader.

Preset section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section has three banks, selected by the three circle buttons at the bottom
of the section.

Loop mode
^^^^^^^^^

Press the top circle button (Bank 1) at the bottom of the section to get into
this mode. The 12 preset buttons are grouped in pairs with the left one
adjusting the loop in point and the right one adjusting the loop out point.

There are two modes of operation selectable by the **looseLoops** global
variable described at the top of this page:

1. **Loose Loops mode** - Works just like a CDJ and the on-screen loop controls.
   Use this for loop rolls.

   -  **Left loop button** - Sets loop in point any time you press it
   -  **Right loop button** - Sets loop out point any time you press it
   -  Reloop/Exit: Hold the **Bank 1** button and press either Left or Right
      loop buttons to toggle the loop on and off

2. **Protected Loops mode** - Works like the hot cue section in that you must
   first delete a loop point before you can set another. Use this when you want
   to return to a pre-set loop and not worry about accidentally losing it.

   -  **Left loop button** - Sets loop in point only when none is already set
   -  **Right loop button** - Sets loop out point only when none is already set
   -  Reloop/Exit: **Both loop buttons together** - Toggles the loop on and off
   -  Delete: Hold the **Bank 1** button and press a Left or Right loop button
      to delete that loop point.

Instant pitch changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bottom two banks are used for instant pitch changes for the current virtual
deck. These are useful when using the pads as samplers to further vary the
sounds.

They offer the following arrangements, increasing from left to right, top to
bottom:

-  **circle buttons** at the bottom:
-  **Middle: Key change** - Center row buttons are one semitone away from their
   vertical neighbors and the outside ones are three semitones away (for
   harmonic key changes.)
-  **Bottom: Notes** - Buttons correspond to major scale notes (ala Vestax
   Controller One.) This is most useful with a constant-pitch sound or chord.
   (You can generate one in Audacity, or use the time code sound. :-) )

Remember you can return to the original pitch (tonic) by pressing Reset just
above the pitch slider.

Note that when you use one of these buttons, the pitch range is automatically
set to 100% in order for the values to be set correctly.

*Key change and Note modes were tuned with respect to 440Hz A (above middle C.)*

Encoder section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pressing any of the encoders returns the parameter to the default value.

-  **circle button** to the left of the section: changes the parameter bank the
   encoders adjust:
-  **Green**:

   -  **1st encoder** (from the left): adjusts low frequency equalizer
   -  **2nd encoder**: adjusts mid frequency equalizer
   -  **3rd encoder**: adjusts high frequency equalizer
   -  **4th encoder**: adjusts deck volume
   -  **circle buttons** under each display: momentary kill buttons for the
      corresponding parameter

-  **Red**:

   -  **1st encoder** (from the left): adjusts flanger depth
   -  **2nd encoder**: adjusts flanger delay
   -  **3rd encoder**: adjusts flanger period (Low Frequency Oscillator)
   -  **4th encoder**: adjusts pre-fader track gain
   -  **circle button** under the 1st display: toggles the flange effect for the
      current deck.
   -  //**circle button** under the 2nd display: unused//
   -  //**circle button** under the 3rd display: unused//
   -  **circle button** under the 4th display: toggles key lock for the current
      deck.

-  When holding down the **Deck Select** button:

   -  **1st encoder** (from the left): adjusts the cue/main headphone mix
   -  **2nd encoder**: adjusts the headphone volume
   -  **3rd encoder**: adjusts the main balance (pan)
   -  **4th encoder**: adjusts the main volume
