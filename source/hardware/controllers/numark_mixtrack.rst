       -  Reloop: exit or reenter loop

    -  Auto Looping

       -  1/2 X: divide loop length by 2
       -  1 Bar: make a loop of just one bar (the current one)
       -  2 X: multiply loop length by 2

The Jogs
~~~~~~~~

Not in scratch mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When not in scratch mode, touching the jogs won’t pause the song. Turning them will slightly adjust the tempo, which will resume slowly to its speed. This slowness to resume is somehow equivalent to
what you would expect from drivebelt turntables. I hate it, and I have not found a way to correct it… This is why I mostly mix using the pitch bend buttons, which allow for an instant resume to the
“pitch slider assigned” pitch for the track.

In scratch mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In scratch mode, touching the jogs will pause the song. The jogs are very sensitive, and allow for scratching and launching tracks on a given moments when “cueing them in your headphones”. Be very
careful with this: never remain in scratch mode if not needed, you will touch the jogs by error and put your tracks out of sync because one has pause, or worse, produce a “blank”.

Known problems
--------------

-  The pitch on the controller has a very short run. Thus, having it configured as a +10/-10 (or more) is tricky because you will get a very low pitch precision. Configuring it as +8/-8 (Mk2 style) is
   highly recommended
-  The autolooping functions, although implemented are quite flawed. The “loop one bar”, which is present since the 1.0b version, is making a loop between two bars, which are rarely fitted on real
   “measures”. As of mixxx 1.9, there is no possibility to adjust the bars to make them fit perfectly to the tempo
-  Pressing play while “cue previewing” should start the track for real, CDJ style. This is not implemented yet, and is marked as a TODO in Mixxx code, so it is unlikely to get implemented on the
   controller mapping side. \*NOTE: If you use the mapping included with the software, this feature is supported. Controls in this mapping are different than the community made one, so be careful.\*
-  Final remark on the hardware design: be very, very careful not to press the “Load A” or “Load B” button, instead of the corresponding track’s “cue” button. They are very near, the error is easy and
   produces the most dire effect in a party: an awful blank !
