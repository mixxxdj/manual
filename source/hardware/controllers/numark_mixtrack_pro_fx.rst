Pitch up/down buttons change pitch by one semitone.

.. hint::
   For more info about Effect Units see :doc:`../../chapters/effects`.

Pads
----

The 8 pads in each deck have multiple functions, depending on the selected *pad mode*. Default pad mode is *hotcues*. Current mode is selected by pressing one of the buttons above the pads. The button for currently active pad mode is lit up (or blinking, when secondary pad mode is selected - secondary pad modes are: beatjump and sampler 2).

Pads support secondary (shift) actions in most pad modes. 4 bottom pads with "special" functions printed on them (:hwlabel:`STUTTER`, etc.) act the same as the top 4 pads, i.e. don't perform any special functions.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "#", "Name", "Function"
   :widths: 5 25 70

   "30", ":hwlabel:`CUE`", "Change pad mode to :term:`hotcues<hotcue>`.

   **Pad press**: set hotcue if not set. If set, go to hotcue position and start playback

   :hwlabel:`SHIFT` **+ pad press**: remove hotcue (if set)

   Pad lights indicate if a particular hotcue is set or not."
   "30", ":hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`CUE`", "Change pad mode to beatjump.

   **Pad press**: beatjump forwards

   :hwlabel:`SHIFT` **+ pad press**: beatjump backwards

   If loop is active, loop is moved forwards/backwards instead.

   Default beatjump values are: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, value set in Mixxx GUI (4 by default), 8. Values can be adjusted, see the :ref:`Adjustable values<numark_mixtrack_pro_fx_adjustable>` section."
   "31", ":hwlabel:`AUTO LOOP`", "Change pad mode to auto-loop.

   **Pad press**: activate auto-loop

   :hwlabel:`SHIFT` **+ pad press (hold)**: activate beatlooproll. When released, playback will resume where the track would have been if it had not entered the loop.

   Default auto-loop sizes are: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8. Loop sizes can be adjusted, see the :ref:`Adjustable values<numark_mixtrack_pro_fx_adjustable>` section."
   "32", ":hwlabel:`FADER CUTS`", "Change pad mode to fader cuts

   This pad mode emulates rapid crossfader movements.

   **Pad press (hold)**: activate a fader cut. The crossfader will rapidly move in one of the 8 available patterns. The crossfader will return to the position of hardware crossfader after the pad is released.

   Note: this function is controlled by the hardware or firmware"
   "33", ":hwlabel:`SAMPLE`", "Change pad mode to sampler 1 (samples 1-8)

   **Pad press**: play a sample

   :hwlabel:`SHIFT` **+ pad press**: stop sample playback"
   "33", ":hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`SAMPLE`", "Change pad mode to sampler 2 (samples 9-16)"
   "34", "Performance pads", "Various functions, depending on selected pad mode"

Notes
-----

* Pressing either :hwlabel:`SHIFT` button will cause both decks to shift (e.g. when pressing :hwlabel:`SHIFT` on deck 1 and then some control on deck 2, the secondary function will be executed). This approach was chosen to be consistent with the behavior of hardware - i.e. pressing either :hwlabel:`SHIFT` changes midi codes of some controls on *both* decks.
* :hwlabel:`SHIFT` + :hwlabel:`TAP` does not trigger BPM rescan, as there is no Mixxx control for this action.
