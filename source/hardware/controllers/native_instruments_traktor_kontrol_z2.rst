Drivers
-------

You can download the latest Windows & MacOS drivers and firmware from the `manufacturer’s website <https://www.native-instruments.com/en/support/downloads/drivers-other-files/>`__.
Since the Traktor Kontrol Z2 is a USB class compliant HID and audio device, the device is plug-and-play on Linux.

.. warning::
   **Parallel installation of Traktor software on Windows**
   If you have a parallel installation of Traktor on Windows, there will be a :file:`NIHardwareService.exe` process that takes control of the Traktor Kontrol Z2's LEDs.
   To make the them work reliable with Mixxx, you either need to uninstall the Traktor software, or stop the process by opening the task manager, selecting :guilabel:`Show processes from all users` and kill the :file:`NIHardwareService.exe` process.

The mapping relies on the following channel assignments:

===================== ================
Output Channels       Assigned to
===================== ================
1-2                   Master
3-4                   Headphones
===================== ================

===================== ================
Input Channels        Assigned to
===================== ================
1-2 (Mic/Aux)         Auxiliary 1
3-4 (CH 1 Line/Phono) Vinyl Control 1
5-6 (CH 2 Line/Phono) Vinyl Control 2
7-8 (Recording)       Record/Broadcast
===================== ================

The mono microphone input and the stereo auxiliary input are mixed with each other in the hardware together in input channels 1-2, so Mixxx can record and broadcast them.

The knobs for :hwlabel:`MASTER`, :hwlabel:`BOOTH`, :hwlabel:`HP VOLUME` are controlling the hardware mixer of the built-in audio interface.
Hence, turning the knobs will not change values in the Mixxx :term:`GUI` and you’ll need to set the Mixxx knobs to their default values when using the controller:

- Set the master/booth/headphones levels to 100% (knob center position)
- Set cue/master mixing to cue-only (leftmost position)

.. note::
   You should assign the :guilabel:`Vinyl Control` input channels even if you do not intend to use timecode vinyl.

Mixer mode (Computer Internal vs. Direct mixer hardware)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Traktor Z2 allows not only mixing using the mixer hardware directly, but also mixing internal in the software of the connected computer.

Unique to the Traktor Z2 is, that the mixer mode can be switched per channel. This allows the user to connect another computer and starting Mixxx, while playing a track from an analog source in direct mode, and than blend over seamless to another channel in Internal mixing mode controlled by Mixxx.

The mixing mode of channel A and B is controlled by the two buttons with the Traktor symbol on top:

======================================  ==================  ==========================================  ====================================================
Direct hardware mixing                  Off                 Press :hwlabel:`Traktor` to toggle          Only Gain, EQ, Filter and Fader of channel operation (works without computer)
Computer Internal mixing (Passthrough)  Dimmed              :hwlabel:`SHIFT` hold + :hwlabel:`Traktor`  Mixxx mixes the signal, but the channel is set to :ref:`Passthrough <interface-passthrough>`. Similar to direct mode, but allows the use of features like software effects.
Computer Internal mixing                Bright              Press :hwlabel:`Traktor` to toggle          Mixxx plays the track and mixes the signal internally.
======================================  ==================  ==========================================  ====================================================

.. note::
   The selection of the mixing mode is a hardware function overruling the software. Only if all channels are switched to computer Internal mixing, you've all features of Mixxx available!
