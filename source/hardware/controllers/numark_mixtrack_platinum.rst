The Numark Mixtrack Platinum is a 2 channel (with 4 channel layering) entry level DJ controller with an integrated audio interface. The stand out feature of the Mixtrack Platinum is the LCD displays
integrated into the jog wheels. It is a USB Audio and MIDI Class compliant device and works with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

.. versionadded:: 2.2

Audio interface
---------------

Configure Mixxx’s Master output for channels 1-2 and Headphones output for Channels 3-4.

The microphone input on this controller is not available to the computer through the controller’s audio interface. It is mixed with the master output in hardware, so this controller’s audio interface
is not suitable for broadcasting or recording the inputs. If you want to use the controller for broadcasting or recording, a separate :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` with a microphone input is suggested.

Configuration Options
---------------------

Configuration options can be set in the mapping. You will need to edit the values below at the very top of the JavaScript file :file:`Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-scripts.js` and save changes. Allowed values
are “true” or “false” unless specified.

-  **EnableWheel:** if true, wheel/vinyl mode will be enabled by default (defaults to true)
-  **ShowTimeElapsed:** if true, time elapsed will be show by default on the displays, otherwise time remaining will be displayed (defaults to true)
-  **UseManualLoopAsCue:** if true, the manual loop controls will behave as hotcues 5-8. When enabled, the normal loop control behavior can be activated using shift+pad mode+mode button and pad
   mode+mode to use the hotcue behavior (defaults to false)
-  **UseAutoLoopAsCue:** if true, the auto loop controls will behave as hotcues 5-8. When enabled, the normal loop control behavior can be activated using shift+pad mode+mode button and pad mode+mode
   to use the hotcue behavior (defaults to false)
-  **UseCueAsSampler:** if true, the hotcues will control sampler slots 5-8 when sampler mode is active. When enabled, the normal hotcue control behavior can be activated using shift+pad mode+sampler
   while pad mode+sampler will activate the special behavior (defaults to false)
-  **ShiftLoadEjects:** if true, pressing shift + load will eject a track (defaults to false)

   Numark Mixtrack Platinum (schematic view)

| 1. **Browse Knob:** Rotate this knob clockwise to scroll down, counter clockwise to scroll up. Press the Knob to load tracks into the inactive deck, expand entries in the library view, and select
  playlists and crates.
| **Shift + Turn:** Page down/page up, allows you to scroll by page instead of by item.
| **Shift + Push:** Focus next library pane, allows you to toggle between the left and right panes.

| 2. **Master Gain:** Adjusts the master volume in the software.
| **Note:** This control does not affect the microphone volume which is summed with the final output of the Master Gain to the Master Output. Use the Mic Gain knob to control the microphone volume.

3. **Cue Mix:** Adjusts the software’s audio output to the headphones, mixing between the cue (PFL) output and the master mix output.

| 4. **Cue Gain:** Adjusts the volume for headphone cueing in the software.
| **Shift+Cue Gain:** adjust the volume of the first 8 sampler banks

5. **VU Meter:** Monitor the volume levels of the master output and each channel. When cue/pfl is active on ANY channel, the meter shows the mono levels each channel (left meter shows the deck on the
left, right meter for the deck on the right). Otherwise the meter shows the stereo levels of the master output.

| 6. **Load:** Press one of these buttons while a track is selected in the library window to assign it to Deck 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4), respectively, in the software.
| **Shift + Load:** Load the track and play (or if the ShiftLoadEjects option is set, eject the track)

| 7. **Gain Knobs:** Adjust the gain of the deck.
| **Shift + Gain:** Adjust parameter 2 of the currently focused effect on this deck.

| 8. **High EQ Knobs:** Adjust the volume of the high frequencies of the deck.
| **Shift + High:** Adjust parameter 3 of the currently focused effect on this deck.

| 9. **Mid EQ Knobs:** Adjust the volume of the mid frequencies of the deck.
| **Shift + Mid:** Adjust parameter 4 of the currently focused effect on this deck.

| 10. **Low EQ Knobs:** Adjust the volume of the low frequencies of the deck.
| **Shift + Low:** Adjust parameter 5 of the currently focused effect on this deck.

| 11. **Filter:** Adjusts the amount of the filter effect. Turning the knob left controls the low pass filter; turning it right controls the high pass filter. The effect applied here can be configured
  (the Quick Effect option in the Equalizer preferences).
| **Shift + Filter:** With no effect focused, this controls the Superknob of the effects unit. With an effect focused, this adjusts parameter 1 of the currently focused effect on this deck.

12. **Cue/PFL/Headphones:** Sends pre-fader audio to the headphone output. If any channels have the cue button active, the VU meter will show channel output levels instead of master output levels on
all decks.

13. **Volume fader:** Adjusts the volume of the deck.

14. **Crossfader:** Controls the blend between the two decks.

| 15-16. **Pitch Bend Down/Up:** Press and hold to momentarily reduce the speed of the track.
| **Shift + Pitch Bend:** adjust the key of the playing track up or down. Press both buttons to reset the key.
| **Pitch Bend Up + Pitch Bend Down:** toggle keylock

17. **Pitch Fader:** Adjust the speed of the music (activate keylock to adjust tempo without affecting pitch). Note that moving the fader down *increases* speed, as marked by the “+” at the bottom of
the fader on the controller. This can be reversed in Mixxx’s preferences under Interface > Speed slider direction.

| 18. **Touch Strip:** Use the Touch Strip to adjust the deck’s Effect Unit Superknob. When an effect is focused, the touch strip controls that effect’s meta knob.
| **Shift + Touch Strip:** search through a track’s timeline

| **Tap + FX 1:** Focus this effect to allow adjusting its metaknob with the touch strip.

| 21. **FX 2 On/Off:** Toggle FX 2 of the deck’s Effect Unit
| **Shift + FX 2:** Cycle to the next effect.
| **Hold + FX 2:** Enable this effect in instant mode, after the button is released the effect will be disabled again.
| **Tap + FX 2:** Focus this effect to allow adjusting its metaknob with the touch strip.

| 22. **FX 3 On/Off:** Toggle FX 3 of the deck’s Effect Unit
| **Shift + FX 3:** Cycle to the next effect.
| **Hold + FX 3:** Enable this effect in instant mode, after the button is released the effect will be disabled again.
| **Tap + FX 3:** Focus this effect to allow adjusting its metaknob with the touch strip.

| 23. **Tap BPM:** Press this button several times on beat to manually enter a new BPM. The software will ignore the track’s BPM and follow your manually entered tempo.
| 24. **Wheel button:** If active you can use the platter/jog wheel to grab and move the audio, scratching the track like a vinyl record.
| **Shift + Wheel:** Toggle elapsed time or time remaining on the deck’s display.

| 25. **Platter/Jog Wheel:** If Wheel is enabled, touching the platter will result in vinyl scratching, when disabled, nothing will happen and the entire jog wheel behaves as if the side was touched.
| **Touch side:** Pitch bend (nudging) if track is playing
| **Shift + Touch platter:** Quickly scroll through the track
| **Shift + Touch side:** Beat jump
| 26. **Jog Wheel Display:** The display is fully functional with this mapping. It will display the position of the spinner, play position, bpm, and keylock status.

27. **Deck Switch:** Allows switching between decks 1/3 and 2/4.

28. **Shift:** Allows alternate options to be activated for various controls.

| 29. **Sync:** Set the BPM of this deck to match the opposite deck. **Press:** Press once to synchronize the tempo (BPM) to that of to that of the other track
| **Long Press:** Enable master sync. Press again to disable.
| **Shift + Sync:** Toggle quantize mode.

| 30. **Cue (Transport Control):** Behavior depends on the :ref:`cue mode <interface-cue-modes>` set in the Mixxx preferences.
| **Shift + Cue:** return the play head to the start of the track and stop the deck.

| 31. **Play/Pause:** Starts and stops playback.
| **Shift + Play/Pause:** stutter the track from the last set cue point. If a cue point has not been set, the play head will return to the start of the track.

| 32. **Pad Mode:** Hold this button to see the currently selected pad mode, while holding select between Manual Loop, Auto Loop, and Sampler modes. Additionally control of hotcues 5-8 can be
  activated using shift+pad mode+loop mode (either manual or auto loop). Setting either of the **UseManualLoopAsCue** or **UseAutoLoopAsCue** options will reverse the selection of hotcue vs loop mode
  when shift is held.
| **Pad Mode+Manual Loop:** set the top row of pads to manual loop control mode (see below)
| **Pad Mode+Auto Loop:** set the top row of pads to auto loop/loop roll control mode (see below)
| **Pad Mode+Sampler:** set the top row of pads to sampler control mode (see below)
| **Shift+Pad Mode+Manual Loop:** set the top row of pads to control hotcues 5-8 (see below)
| **Shift+Pad Mode+Auto Loop:** set the top row of pads to control hotcues 5-8 (see below)
| **Shift+Pad Mode+Sampler:** set the bottom row of pads to control sampler banks 5-8 (see below)

33. **Performance Pads:**

The top row of pads is for controlling loops and samples. To select a mode, hold down the Pad Mode button and press one of the upper pads. An LED under the pad section indicates the currently selected
mode. See the subsections below for details about each mode.

| The bottom row of pads is used to trigger hotcue points. If a hotcue point has not already been set for the loaded track, this control will mark the hotcue point. If a hotcue point has already been
  set, this control will jump to it.
| **Shift + Hot Cue**: Deletes the assigned hotcue point

Note: the top row can be made to control hotcues 5-8 using shift+pad mode+loop mode (being Auto Loop or Manual Loop). This can also be made the default using a config option (see documentation above
and below).

Manual Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hold Pad Mode and press the pad marked Manual Loop (silkscreened above the pad) to assign the upper 4 pads to the functions listed below:

-  **Loop In** – Sets the beginning of a loop: When assigned, the Pad LED will light blue
-  **Loop Out** – Sets the end point for the loop: When assigned, the Pad LED will light blue
-  **On/Off** – (De)activate the loop. If a loop has not been set, this button will have no effect.: When assigned, the Pad LED will light blue
-  **Loop x1/2** – Halve the length of the loop. Press Shift + Loop x1/2 to double the length of the loop. Note that this does not update the beatloop size shown on screen.

If Manual Loop is selected with Shift and Pad Mode held down this will activate control of hotcues 5-8 on the upper row instead of the looping controls. Select Manual Loop again while holding Pad Mode
to restore the default behavior. There will be no indication of which mode is selected (beyond the LEDs on the keys themselves, which will vary depending on loop and hotcue status). The
**UseManualLoopAsCue** config option can be set in the mapping file (see above) to swap the default “shadow” mode of the looping controls such that hotcue control will be the default and manual loop
control with be selected when Shift is used.

Auto Loop Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Hold Pad Mode and press the pad marked Auto Loop to assign the upper 4 pads to the functions listed below:
| \* **Auto 1:** – Sets and starts playback of a 1-beat autoloop.

-  **Auto 2:** – Sets and starts playback of a 2-beat autoloop.
-  **Auto 3:** – Sets and starts playback of a 4-beat autoloop.
-  **Auto 4:** – Sets and starts playback of a 8-beat autoloop.
   \* **Shift + Auto 1:** – When held, starts a 1/16-beat loop roll.
-  **Shift + Auto 2:** – When held, starts a 1/8-beat loop roll.
-  **Shift + Auto 3:** – When held, starts a 1/4-beat loop roll.
-  **Shift + Auto 4:** – When held, starts a 1/2-beat loop roll.

Note: loop rolls activate slip mode so the play position continues to advance normally, such that when the loop is released, play continues from the place it would have been if no loop had been
activated.

If Auto Loop is selected with Shift and Pad Mode held down this will activate control of hotcues 5-8 on the upper row instead of the looping controls. Select Auto Loop again while holding Pad Mode to
restore the default behavior. There will be no indication of which mode is selected (beyond the LEDs on the keys themselves, which will vary depending on loop and hotcue status). The
**UseAutoLoopAsCue** config option can be set in the mapping file (see above) to swap the default “shadow” mode of the looping controls such that hotcue control will be the default and auto loop
control with be selected when Shift is used.

Sample Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

Hold Pad Mode and press the pad marked Sampler to enter sampler mode (hold down shift as well to control slots 5-8 using the hotcue buttons). A press of any of the sample buttons will load a sample if
the sampler is not loaded. Shift + sample pad will unload a sample if it is not playing. Pressing a pad when a sample is loaded will play the sample, pressing shift + sample pad while a sample is
playing will stop it.

Use **shift+cue gain** to adjust the volume of the sampler. When switching to the pad mode to sampler, hold down shift to control slots 5-8 using the hotcue buttons.

Note: the 8 sample slots on each deck all control the same 8 slots in Mixxx no matter which deck the sampler is active on. This is because the controller sends the same MIDI codes for button presses
on each side, so there is no way for Mixxx to tell whether a sampler button was pressed on the left or right side of the controller.
