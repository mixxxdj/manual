Mapping description
-------------------

-  The main keyboard is mapped to the 64 Samplers slots for Skins that have them, since it has 25 keys, upper Samplers can be accessed by pressing the Octave Up/Down buttons.
-  The 8 pressure sentitive drum pads are attached to 6 Effects, 3 for FX1 and 3 for FX2, the last two pads are mapped for a fourth effect for when it will be available.
   Tap gently on a pad to select it for editing, Tap hard to switch the effect On/Off.
   The red/green bank A/B currently does nothing.
-  The 8 knobs are attached to the controls of the selected effect, in order left-right, top-bottom.

Experiments with Samplers and Velocity
--------------------------------------

The main keyboard supports the pressure velocity, this is mapped to the pregain of the attached sample, so different playing styles can be applied, even if only approximated.
If you map the Grand Piano notes to all Samplers, you can actually play a Grand Piano on top of whatever is playing on the decs.
