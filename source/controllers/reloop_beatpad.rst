Reloop Beatpad
==============

The **Reloop Beatpad** is a conventional 2 channel controller that is primarily
designed to work with algoriddim‘s djay on the iOS platform and more recently on
the Android platform, but can also be used with Mixxx by sending MIDI signals to
a computer with a USB cable.

.. versionadded:: 2.0

Mixer Section
-------------

Crossfader
~~~~~~~~~~

Blends audio between left and right mixer channels.

Volume Faders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjust the Volume of each channel. If `Fader Start <reloop-beatpad-trackselect>`
is enabled the deck will stop at the previously used Cue if the Volume Fader
reaches the minimum position and will start playing if the Volume fader moves
from the minimum position.

.. _reloop-beatpad-trackselect:

1 and 2 (Track select buttons)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Load a track:** Press these buttons to load the selected track from the
   Browser to left or right deck. The LED of the button will be on if the deck
   is loaded.
-  **Eject:** Hold the same button for more than half of a second to unload the
   same deck.
-  **Fader Start:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press one of these
   buttons to enable the **Fader Start** on a deck. The LED of the button will
   blink if Fader Start is enabled. If Fader Start is enabled the deck will stop
   at the previously used Cue if the Volume Fader reaches the minimum position
   and will start playing if the Volume fader moves from the minimum position.

PFL (symbolized by a headphone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  \**PFL: \**Press these buttons to send each channel to the Headphones Output
   channel for pre-listening.
-  \**Slip mode: \**Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press these buttons to
   activate/deactivate Slip Mode. When active, the playback continues muted in
   the background during a loop, scratch etc. Once disabled, the audible
   playback will resume where the track would have been.
-  **Quantize mode:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press these buttons
   to activate/deactivate the Quantize mode. When active, it aligns Hot-cues
   and Loops to the next beat from the current position.

Equalizer
~~~~~~~~~

-  **LOW:** Adjust the Low (Bass) frequencies for each mixer channel.
-  **MID:** Adjust the Mid frequencies for each mixer channel.
-  **HIGH:** Adjust the High (Treble) frequencies for each mixer channel.
-  **GAIN:** Adjust the Gain of each mixer channel.
-  **MASTER:** Adjust the level of the Master Output.
-  **Cue Mix (Hadphones mixing):** Adjust how the Channels and the Master Output
   blend at the Headphones Channel.
-  **Phones (Hadphones level):** Adjust the Volume Output of the Headphones
   Channel.
-  **AUX:** Adjust the Volume of the AUX Input.

The MASTER, Phones, and AUX knobs adjust the levels of the Beatpad’s sound card;
they do not control the software gains in Mixxx so the changes are not visible
on screen.

.. _reloop-beatpad-rec:

REC
~~~

-  **Record:** Use this button to start/stop recording your mixing session.
-  **End track warning:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press this
   button in order to toggle **on** or **off** the red flashing of the :ref:`jog wheels <reloop-beatpad-jogwheel>`
   when the playback reaches the end of the track.

Browse Knob
~~~~~~~~~~~

Scroll through your library.

-  **Turn** to select a track in the song list.
-  **Push** to load the selected track into first stop deck.
-  :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>`\ **\ +Turn** to select a folder or subfolder in the left
   item list sidebar.
-  :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>`\ **\ +Push** to open/close folders and subfolders in the
   left item list sidebar.

Deck Controls Section
---------------------

.. _reloop-beatpad-shift:

SHIFT
~~~~~

Press and hold one of those buttons to access secondary functions of other
controls on the Beatpad. The secondary functions can be accessed while the
**SHIFT** button is held down. If the **SHIFT LOCK** switch on the back side of
the Reloop Beatpad is on, the secondary functions can be accessed after the
button **SHIFT** button is released and until the **SHIFT** is pressed again.

.. _reloop-beatpad-playpause:

PLAY/PAUSE
~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Play/pause:** Press to play/pause the track. If there was no track loaded
   into the deck and a track is selected in the library, it is loaded and starts
   playing.
-  **Censor:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press this button to play
   the track in reverse. When released the track will continue to play from the
   position it would have been if the button was never pressed. In other words,
   it enables reverse and slip mode while held.

.. _reloop-beatpad-jump:

JUMP
~~~~

-  **While playing, or stopped:** If the Cue point is set, seeks the player to
   it and starts playback.
-  **Brake:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press this button to stop
   the track with a gradual brake. If the **JUMP** button is released before the
   track has completely stopped, the track is then played back to its regular
   speed.
-  **Spinback:** see the :ref:`Instant FX <reloop-beatpad-instantfx>` usage.

SET
~~~

-  **While playing:** Seeks the track to the cue-point and stops.
-  **While stopped:** Sets the cue point (Pioneer/Mixxx mode) OR preview from it
   (Denon mode).
   If the Cue point is already set at the current position of the track, hold
   this button to play the track and release it to return to the Cue point and
   pause it. To continue playback without returning to the Cue Point, press and
   hold the **SET** Button, then press and hold the :ref:`Play/Pause <reloop-beatpad-playpause>`
   Button and then release both buttons.
-  **Key lock:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press this button to
   enable/disable the Key-lock.

.. hint:: Change the default cue mode in Preferences -> Interface. The
          Pioneer mode is the more consistent with the Reloop Beatpad.

SYNC
~~~~

-  **Press once** to synchronize the tempo (BPM) and phase to that of the other
   track.
-  **Press twice quickly** to play the track immediately, synchronized to the
   tempo (BPM) and to the phase of the other track, if the track was paused.
-  **Sync Lock:** Hold for at least half of a second to enable **sync lock** for
   this deck. Decks with sync locked will all play at the same tempo, and decks
   that also have **quantize** enabled (which is enabled by default by the
   mapping) will always have their beats lined up.
   **Note :** the **quantize** mode is not mapped on the controller but can be
   enabled/desabled from Mixxx.

.. _reloop-beatpad-jogwheel:

Jogwheel
~~~~~~~~

| Touch sensitive platters for scratching (Scratch mode/iCut mode), bending
  (Scratch mode/CD mode) or Seek mode.
| The jogwheel offers multi-color leds, which will show the playing marker
  (Scratch mode), the song progress bar (in Seek mode), and other colored
  combinations depending on the applied effect, loop, loop roll or Filter. If no
  track is loaded, the jogwheel displays a red cross. At the end of a track, the
  jogwheel is flashing red faster and faster until it reaches the end of the
  track (full steady red).
| You can toggle on/off this behavior with :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` + :ref:`REC <reloop-beatpad-rec>`.

.. _reloop-beatpad-scratchmode:

Scratch mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Toggle with the **JOG SCRATCH** button.
| Use the jogwheel to scratch and the outer ring to bend (like in :ref:`CD mode <reloop-beatpad-cdmode>`).

-  **iCut mode:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and scratch to scratch in
   “automagic” scratch mode. When the jog wheel is turned back, the crossfader
   is closed. When the jog wheel is turned forward, the crossfader opens. (Note
   that the Algoriddim djay mapping actually closes/opens the crossfader quickly
   without taking into account the direction of the wheel, contrary to what the
   Beatpad’s Quick Start guide says.)

.. _reloop-beatpad-seekmode:

Seek mode
^^^^^^^^^

| Toggle with the **JOG SEEK** button.
| Use the jogwheel to navigate through the track.


.. _reloop-beatpad-cdmode:

CD mode
^^^^^^^

| Deactivate both the :ref:`Scratch mode <reloop-beatpad-scratchmode>` and the :ref:`Seek mode <reloop-beatpad-seekmode>` to enable this mode.
| Use the jogwheel to temporarily bend the pitch of the track (which only
  affects the tempo with keylock on).

PITCH BEND
~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Pitch bend:** Use these buttons temporary slow-down/speed up the tempo of
   the track.
   Once the buttons are released the track will continue to play at the tempo
   designated by the pitch fader.
-  **Beat Jump:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then use these buttons to
   jump 1 beat backwards or forward.

PITCH
~~~~~

Controls the track’s pitch. With keylock on, this only changes the tempo. The
red LED indicates that the pitch fader of the unit is on zero (center) position.

.. _reloop-beatpad-loops:

Loops Section
-------------

-  **Loop size:** Turn the encoder to select the number of beats for a loop.
   Turn it counterclockwise to half the size of the loop and clockwise to double
   it.
-  **Loop move:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then use the encoder to move
   the triggered loop forward or backwards by 1 beat.
-  **Activate/deactivate:** (Acts exactly like the :ref:`LOOP <reloop-beatpad-loops>` Button)
-  **Regular loop mode:** Push (and release) the encoder to trigger a loop of
   the selected size
-  **Roll loop mode:** Press (and hold down) to trigger a momentary rolling loop
   of the selected size. While the encoder is held down, the track will keep
   moving forward as if it was not looping, so when the encoder is released, it
   will jump forward to where the track would have been if the rolling loop was
   never enabled. In other words, this is a regular loop in slip mode.
-  **Toggle loop mode:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then push the encoder
   to toggle between Regular and Roll Loop mode.

.. seealso:: Rolling loops can be set using the :ref:`Bounce Loop (Roll) mode <reloop-beatpad-rollmode>`.

.. _reloop-beatpad-effects:

Effects Section
---------------

FX ON
~~~~~

Push (and release) this button to trigger the selected effect chain for the
corresponding deck (toggle function).

FX SELECT
~~~~~~~~~

-  **Select:** Use this encoder to select an effect for the current selected
   rack.
-  **Temporary effect:** Push and hold the encoder to temporarily apply the
   effect of the current selected rack for the corresponding deck (while
   pressed).
-  **Quick Effect:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then push the encoder
   Activate or Kill the **Quick Effect**. You can change the Quick effect
   assigned in Mixxx, via Options -> Settings-> Equalizers -> Quick Effect.

FX PARAM
~~~~~~~~

-  **SUPER:** Use this knob to control the **SUPER** parameter of the effect for
   the current selected rack.
-  **MIX:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then use this knob to control the
   **MIX** parameter of the effect for the current selected rack.

FILTER
~~~~~~

-  **Quick Effect:** Use this knob to apply the Quick effect (by default, this
   is Filter, but you can change it) to the deck. In middle position no effect
   is applied for filter.
-  **Key:** Hold SHIFT down and use this knob to adjust the key (pitch) of the
   track without changing the tempo. In middle position the track will have its
   original key.

Pads Section
------------

The 4 Performance Pads offer 4 different modes, depending on the 4 PAD MODE
buttons just above.

HotCues mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

CUE
^^^

Press the **CUE** mode button to set the PADs to HOT CUE mode.

Pads
^^^^

-  **Press** each one of the 4 pads to assign a Hot Cue Point (1 to 4) or
   returns the track to that Hot Cue Point. When a Hot Cue Button is unlit, you
   can assign a Hot Cue Point by pressing it at the desired point in your track.
   Once it is assigned, the Hot Cue Button will light up blue.
-  ** :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` + Press** to delete its assigned Hot Cue Point.

.. _reloop-beatpad-rollmode:

Bounce Loop (Roll) mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BOUNCE LOOP
^^^^^^^^^^^

Press the **BOUNCE LOOP** mode button to set the PADs to Loop Roll mode.

Pads
^^^^

Press (and keep down) any of the 4 pads to trigger a momentary
:ref:`Loop Roll <interface-looping>` of a different size (in beats) as per the
table.

===================+++++===================== === === === ===
Pads                                            1   2   3   4
Press                                         1/8 1/4 1/2   1
:ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` + Press     2   4   8  16
===========++================================ === === === ===

Once the PAD is released the track will continue to play from the position it
would have been if the Loop Roll was never triggered. The size of the applied
Loop Roll can be adjusted with the :ref:`LOOP SIZE <reloop-beatpad-loops>` encoder as well.
Pads change the “selected loop size” introduced in :ref:`LOOP SIZE <reloop-beatpad-loops>`
and :ref:`LOOP <reloop-beatpad-loops>` sections.

Instant FX mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _reloop-beatpad-instantfx:

Instant FX
^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Press** this button to set the PADs to Effects mode.
-  **Spinback:** Hold :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then press this button down in
   order to stop the track with a backward brake effect. If the Instant
   FX button is released before the track has completely
   stopped, the track is then played back to its regular speed, in the forward
   direction.
-  **Brake :** see :ref:`JUMP <reloop-beatpad-jump>` button usage

Pads
^^^^

-  **Instant FX:** Press (and keep down) any of the 4 pads to apply momentarily
   the effect of the corresponding effect rack. The parameters of these effects
   can be adjusted from the :ref:`FX PARAM <reloop-beatpad-effects>` knob.
-  **Current effect rack selection:** Hold `SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` down and then
   press any of the 4 pads to select the current effect rack for this deck that
   will be used for effect selection or for the corresponding effect to be
   triggered later on (see :ref:`Effects Section <reloop-beatpad-effects>`).
   this can also be done with a visual feedback in :ref:`Sampler mode <reloop-beatpad-samplermode>`.

.. _reloop-beatpad-samplermode:

Sampler mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note:** On account of the Reloop Beatpad limitations (bug ?), lights will not
show on in Sampler mode when the controller is in :ref:`SHIFT <reloop-beatpad-shift>` mode.

Press the SAMPLER mode button to set the PADs to cycle between 4 sub modes:

-   **Sampler mode** (orange LEDs): each pad triggers a sample from the selected Sampler bank. The PADs wgich are lit indicate which samples are loaded and ready to use. While a sample is playing, the corresponding PAD changes its color to pink.
-   **Sampler bank selection mode** (pink LED): each pad selects 1 of the 4 sampler banks. The PAD that is lit indicates which bank is active.
-   **Loop mode** status and selection (magenta LEDs): press any pad to toggle between :ref:`regular loop mode <reloop-beatpad-loops>` and :ref:`roll loop mode <reloop-beatpad-loops>`. **Regular loop mode** is symbolized by the left PAD lit, representing the loop), and all the others switched off. **Roll loop mode** is symbolized by both the left (representing the loop) and the right PADs lit (symbolizing the position after the loop where the track will continue to play when the loop will be triggered off).
-   **Effect rack selection** mode (purple LED): each pads selects 1 of the 4 effect racks. The PAD which is lit indicates which effect rack is active (see :ref:`Effect Section <reloop-beatpad-effects>`).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Grounding problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your controller randomly freezes or your iPad or Android tablet acts weirdly
(screen flashing, bad sound), make a home made, grounded power cable.

Controller not detected by Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see a yellow exclamation point (!) in the Windows Device Manager
indicating that the drivers did not start, unplug the power cable from your
laptop then unplug/replug the USB cable from your controller. If that does not
work, restart your laptop without the power cable plugged in.
