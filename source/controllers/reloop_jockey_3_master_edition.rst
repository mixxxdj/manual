Setup

MIDI channels as the default 1-4. If you have problems with the jogwheels, set
the jogwheel resolution to 2048. (Please read the manual of this Controller
section **5.1** and **5.1.2**)

Set the Input 1 and Input 2 switches on the front side of the Jockey 3 ME to SW.

Mapping Description
-------------------

Mixer Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Trax encoder**: scroll through library. With shift, scroll through sections
   on the left side of the library. Push to toggle big library.
-  **Load button**: load selected track into active deck
-  **Deck switches**: select between controlling deck 1/3 or analog input 1 on
   the left; select between controlling deck 2/4 or analog input 2 on the right.
   Note that the analog inputs are only affected by the mixer controls but not
   the other deck controls.
-  **Gain**: set :ref:`deck gain <interface-gain-knob>`
-  **High/mid/low**: adjust EQ for high/mid/low frequencies
-  **Master/booth/phones**: control the Jockey 3 ME’s sound card. These knobs do
   not send MIDI messages or adjust values in Mixxx, so turning them will not
   change anything on screen. Use these but :ref:`don't change the software knobs on screen in
   Mixxx <interface-gain-knob>`.
-  **Headphones**: play deck on headphone output
-  **Cuemix**: Fade between PFL and main output on headphones
-  **Vertical faders**: deck volume
-  **Level meter LEDs**: show the level of the deck
-  **Crossfader**: fade between decks
-  **Crossfader curve** (front side of controller): Adjust crossfader curve
   between fade and cut.

Transport Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Play/pause**: play/pause or, with shift, toggle keylock
-  **Cue**: behavior depends on :ref:`cue mode set in Mixxx preferences <interface-cue-modes>`.
   With shift, it does not work as labeled; it toggles quantize.
-  **Cup**: Like Cue, but it plays only after releasing the button.
-  **Sync**: toggle sync lock. With shift, it does not work as labeled; it
   toggles microphone talkover.

Jogwheels
~~~~~~~~~

Set the jog wheel mode by pressing one of the 4 buttons beside the jog wheel,
below the trash and 5-8 buttons.

-  **Off**: By default, all mode buttons are off. In this default mode, moving
   the jogwheel temporarily bends the pitch, regardless of whether it is moved
   from the top or the side.
-  **Scratch**: Move the wheel from the top to scratch. Touch the outside rubber
   ring to temporarily bend the pitch.
-  **Pitch bend**: Move the wheel to control the SuperKnob on EffectUnit of this
   Deck. FIXME (Maybe a Touch Control?)
-  **Search**: Search position in file quickly. Touch stops the Deck.
-  **Trax**: Not Mapped. FIXME (No Plans)

Hotcue Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press an unlit hotcue button to set that hotcue at the current position. Press a
lit hotcue button to jump to that hotcue. To delete a hotcue, hold the Trash
button while pressing a hotcue. To toggle between hotcues 1-4 and 5-8, press the
5-8 button.

Loop Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Length encoder**: Press to activate a 4 beat loop. Double or half the beats
   of the loop by turning
-  **Move encoder**: Move a track 4 Beats forward or backward. Push, hold and
   Turn it to halve or double the value of 4 Beats.
-  **Loop button**: Turn on/off a Loop that is set from Length encoder. With
   shift, sets the start position of a loop.
-  **Reloop button**: Repeat the entire file. With shift, sets the end position
   of a loop.

Other controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Filter**: turn to apply a highpass or lowpass filter. On Deck A, press
   Shift and turn Filter to adjust the Gain of the Microphone
-  **Pan**: On Deck A, turn to fade between the left and right speakers on the
   main output. (Balance)
-  **< Beat**: Beatjump by one beat back. With shift, moves the beatgrid lines
   further from each other (lower BPM by 0.01)
-  **Beat >**: Beatjump by one beat forward. With shift, moves beatgrid lines
   closer to each other (raise BPM by 0.01)
-  **Pitch fader**: adjust playback rate of deck (with keylock, only adjusts
   tempo and not pitch)
-  **+/-**: Pitch temporarily faster or slower.
-  **FX 1**: Shift - (Minus) does not function as labeled. It aligns the
   beatgrid with the current play position.

Effect Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The effect section controls the effect chain with the same number as the deck
selected by the deck switch, although any effect chain can be applied to any
deck.

-  **Dry/wet**: adjust how much the effect is applied. With shift, turn to
   select different effect chain presets
-  **FX Param**: adjust effect parameters 1-3 for the first effect in the chain.
-  **Press FX Param 1-3 + Shift**: edit how effect parameters are linked to the
   superknob. The effect selected corresponds to the number of the FX Param
   encoder pressed. For example, pressing FX Param 2 with shift on deck 3 edits
   Effect2 of the EffectRack3. Each encoder press with shift changes what is
   being edited:

   -  Select which effect parameter to edit
   -  Select a [[effects framework#linking values|superknob link type between 0
      and 4]] for the parameter selected on the first press
   -  Select whether the [[effects framework#linking values|superknob link is
      inverted]] for the parameter selected on the first press
   -  Close superknob link editing mode

-  **FX on**: enable/disable effect chain
-  **FX B1/2/3**: enable/disable effect 1/2/3 on this chain
-  **Preset 1-4** (shift+effect buttons): apply effect chain to that deck number
