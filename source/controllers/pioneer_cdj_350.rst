Pioneer CDJ-350
===============

This is a CD and USB media player that can control Mixxx via USB with
MIDI. The device can also send HID signals to computers, but no Mixxx
mapping has been made for this device’s HID signals. It can also control
Mixxx by playing timecode from a CD or USB drive and running that signal
into Mixxx through a sound card.
