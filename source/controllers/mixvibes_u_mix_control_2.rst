MixVibes U-Mix Control (Pro) 2
==============================

The MixVibes U-Mix Control Pro 2 is a MIDI DJ controller with an **internal soundcard** and **two
Inputs** for Turntables or any Audio-Source with RCA. It offers also a **changeable** Cross-fader, **adjustable**
Cross-Fader **Curve** and **individual Touch-Level-Sensors**.
The U-Mix Control **Pro** differs only in Cue-Button-Labels
The U-Mix Control 2 (without “Pro” = internal soundcard) also. Both should work fine with this MIDI mapping.
