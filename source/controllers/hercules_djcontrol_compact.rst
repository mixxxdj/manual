The Hercules DJControl Compact is a simple controller for basic
two-channel mixing. This device does not have a built in sound card, so
it would require a :ref:`splitter cable <hardware-splitter-cables>` or
:ref:`separate audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` to be able to
preview tracks in headphones. It also does not have buttons for routing
decks to headphones.

Thanks to Hercules for supporting the development of this mapping by
providing a controller.

.. versionadded:: 2.1

Mapping description
-------------------

Much of the Compact’s behavior is hard-coded into its firmware,
including shift button messages and button mode selections.

Shift + Play jumps to the beginning of the track and stops playback.

The cue button behaves differently depending on the :ref:`cue mode set in Mixxx’s Preferences <interface-cue-modes>`.

The sync button synchronizes the tempo to the other deck.
Press and hold sync to engage :ref:`Sync Lock <sync-lock>`.

There is only one each of the Mode, Shift, and Scratch buttons, so they
affect both decks.

Shift + Scratch (Automix) toggles AutoDJ on/off.

Jog Wheels
~~~~~~~~~~

When Scratch is off, turning a jog wheel bends the pitch of the track.
When Scratch is on, turning a jog wheel scratches that deck. Holding
Shift and turning a jog wheel adjusts the playback rate (tempo). Enable
keylock on a deck by clicking the music note button on screen if you do
not want the pitch to change when adjusting the tempo.

Pad Grid
~~~~~~~~

Press the MODE button to cycle through each pad mode.

Loop mode
^^^^^^^^^

In loop mode, the buttons are mapped in a way that’s more artistically
expressive:

-  Button 1 enables and disables the loop
-  Button 2 enables an 8 beat loop
-  Button 3 divides the current loop in half
-  Button 4 doubles the length of the current loop
-  Shift + Button 1 performs an 1/8th beat roll
-  Shift + Button 2 performs an 1/4th beat roll
-  Shift + Button 3 performs an 1/2th beat roll
-  Shift + Button 4 performs an 1 beat roll

FX mode
^^^^^^^

-  Button 1 enables and disables the first FX chain for Channel 1
-  Button 2 enables and disables the second FX chain for Channel 1
-  Button 1 enables and disables the first FX chain for Channel 2
-  Button 2 enables and disables the second FX chain for Channel 2

Shift-FX buttons are not mapped.

Sampler mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Left side buttons play Sample Decks 1 through 4
-  Right side buttons play Sample Decks 5 through 8
-  Shift + Buttons stops Sample Deck and puts the playhead at the cue
   point

Cue mode
^^^^^^^^

-  Each button activates the hotcue with that number
-  Shift + button clears the hotcue with that number
