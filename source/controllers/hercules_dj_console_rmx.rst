Hercules DJ Console RMX
=======================

-  `Manufacturer’s product page <https://support.hercules.com/en/product/djconsolermx-en/>`__

The Hercules DJ Console RMX is a USB controller with a built in sound
card. It is a class compliant USB Audio and HID device. Older versions
of Mixxx that did not support HID required using Hercules’ MIDI driver,
but it is now recommend to not use the Hercules driver on GNU/Linux. If
you have it installed, it is recommended to uninstall the driver and
upgrade to the `latest version of Mixxx <http://mixxx.org/download>`__
if you have not already. On Windows (and Mac OS X?) the driver is still
recommended.

.. versionadded:: 1.11

Audio
-----

The sound card has 4 inputs and 4 outputs (2 stereo in/out). The inputs
are switchable between line-in and phono, so you can connect both CD
players and turntables on the inputs. The inputs require a high input
signal (~10mV+) for turntables if you want to record audio or mix it to
the output. Time-coded vinyls, for Vinyl Control, should work okay with
lower input signal.

Advanced mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advanced mapping works similar to the normal RMX mapping, but also
supports loops and hot cues. This mapping was added to not brake the
previous (Mixxx -1.7.2) behaviour. Controls that differ between the
normal and advanced mappings are described here.
