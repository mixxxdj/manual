Reloop Beatmix 2
================

The **Reloop Beatmix 2** is a performance-oriented 2-channel pad controller with
integrated soundcard. **Beatmix 2** offers an ergonomically designed 2-channel
mixer layout, optimized for the club allowing you to work intuitively: Dedicated
equalizer and gain dials, high-quality line-faders, an extremely smooth-running
crossfader, 16 multi-colour drum pads, as well as two extensive FX units are the
foundation for your creativity.

This controller is a midi and audio class compliant device so it is compatible
as-is with Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, on Windows, the manufacturer ship
an ASIO low-latency driver that can be found on the `manufacturer’s product
page <productpage_url_>`_.

The mapping for the :ref:`Reloop Beatmix 4 <reloop-beatmix-4>` should be
compatible with this controller, but hasn’t been tested. See the
:ref:`Reloop Beatmix 4 <reloop-beatmix-4>` page for the complete mapping
