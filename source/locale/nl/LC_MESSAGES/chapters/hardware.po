"DJ controllers are devices with knobs, faders, buttons, and jog wheels to "
"control DJ software such as Mixxx. Controllers allow quick access to "
"different controls while providing tactile and visual feedback indicating "
"the state of each control, such as the position of a knob or whether a "
"switch is on or off. This allows you to focus on manipulating the music "
"without needing to look at your computer screen all the time. Controllers "
"also allow using two hands to manipulate two different controls at the same "
"time, which is required for many mixing techniques."

"DJ controllers typically do not do any actual audio processing. Instead, "
"they send signals (typically :term:`MIDI` or :term:`HID` over a USB cable) "
"to the computer to instruct DJ software how to manipulate the audio. Many DJ"
" controllers include an :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` "
"with 2 separate stereo outputs built into the device. This allows the DJ to "
"transport and setup only one piece of hardware in addition to a laptop. Some"
" devices can be used as both a controller and :ref:`hardware mixer "

"mapping presets, which are listed in the `Mixxx DJ Hardware Guide "
"<https://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/hardware_compatibility>`_ on the wiki. For "
"controllers that Mixxx does not yet support, you can `search the forum "

"An audio interface (also known as a \"sound card\", although few of them are"
" shaped like cards anymore) is a device that allows a computer to send "
"output to and receive input from audio equipment. Whether using "
":ref:`internal or external mixing <intro-how-mixxx-works>`, it is "
"recommended to use a single audio interface with at least 4 independent "
"output channels (2 separate stereo pairs)."

"The headphone jack on most laptops is not a second audio output. Rather, "
"plugging headphones into the jack simply redirects the laptop's single "
"stereo output from its speakers to your headphones. A splitter cable can be "
"used to separate the stereo output of a headphone jack into two separate "
"mono outputs for headphone cueing, but it is recommended to use a sound card"
" with at least four mono outputs (for two stereo pairs). Such sound cards "
"tend to be higher quality than those built into laptops and allow your mix "
"to be enjoyed in stereo by your audience."

"Unlike some proprietary DJ systems, Mixxx can use any audio interface and "

"Half the sample rate determines the maximum frequency that can be "
"represented by the signal. Humans generally can't hear frequencies above 20 "
"kHz, so a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, representing a maximum frequency of "
"22.05 kHz, is fine for playback. Higher sample rates like 88.2 kHz and 96 "
"kHz can be helpful to reduce aliasing distortion when recording, but have no"

"Audio interfaces sometimes have multiple connectors for a single channel, "
"resulting in more connectors than channels. So, not every connector can send"
" or receive and independent signal. For example, some audio interfaces made "
"for DJing have 4 output channels with 4 mono output connectors and 1 stereo "
"headphone connector. This does not mean that the audio interface can send "
"out 6 different signals at the same time; rather, the signal on 2 of the "
"mono outputs and the stereo headphone output would be the same. Also, many "
"controllers have separate master and booth outputs with independent volume "

msgid ""
"Turntables output low voltage (phono level) signals that need to be "
"amplified to line level before most audio equipment can work with them. So, "
"if you want to use :ref:`vinyl-control`, sometimes referred to as a Digital "
"Vinyl System (DVS), it is best to have phono preamplifiers (one for each "
"deck) somewhere between your turntable and sound card to boost the "
"turntable's phono level signal to line level. Mixxx can amplify phono level "
"signals in software, but it is better to do it in hardware. The phono preamp"
" can be in the turntable, in the audio interface, or a stand alone device. "
"Most audio interfaces do not have phono preamps; these are generally found "
"on audio interfaces specifically made for controlling DJ software with "
"timecode vinyl. :ref:`hardware-mixers` with audio interfaces have phono "
"preamps on their deck inputs, but not necessarily on every deck input. Many "
"higher-end all-in-one controllers also include audio interfaces with phono "

msgid ""
"Mixers are devices that combine audio signals. DJ mixers are different from "
"live and studio mixers because they have multiple stereo channels with phono"
" preamplifiers for connecting :ref:`hardware-turntables`. It is conventional"
" to use a DJ mixer with :ref:`vinyl-control`, but vinyl control can be used "
"without a hardware mixer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using Mixxx with a DJ mixer requires an audio interface with at least 4 mono"
" outputs (2 stereo pairs) to send Mixxx's decks to the mixer's stereo "
"channels. Some DJ mixers have a USB :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-"
"interfaces>` built into them. This lets Mixxx send unmixed audio files "
"directly to the mixer without needing a separate stand-alone audio "
"interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/hardware.rst:188
msgid ""
"Often DJs who use DJ software with internal mixing send their master output "
"to a hardware mixer. This can be helpful to send the mixed signal to both a "
"main speaker output for the audience and booth speakers for the DJ with "
"separate gain controls for each output. It also facilitates smooth "
"transitions between DJs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/hardware.rst:194
msgid ""
"However, using an external mixer with internal mixing is not necessary and "
"reduces the sound quality. Each piece of equipment an audio signal passes "
"through reduces the sound quality, so avoiding unnecessary equipment in the "
"signal path can provide better sound quality. Many DJ controllers provide "
"separate master and booth outputs with independent volume controls. "
"Alternatively, a sound card with at least 6 output channels can be used with"
" Mixxx's :guilabel:`Booth` output."
