"To achieve the best performance with Mixxx it is essential to configure your"
" *audio buffer*, *sample rate*, and *audio API*. These three factors largely"
" determine Mixxx's responsiveness and reliability. The optimal settings will"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The audio buffer is the amount of audio in milliseconds that Mixxx processes"
" at a time. This is a major factor that determines the latency between "
"changing controls in Mixxx such as moving the :term:`crossfader` or pressing"
" the play button and hearing the audio change. For example, with an audio "
"buffer of 23 ms, it will take approximately 23 milliseconds for Mixxx to "
"stop the audio after you toggle the play button. The actual latency will be "
"longer depending on a variety of factors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:40
msgid ""
"The audio buffer setting determines how quickly your :term:`operating "
"system` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller audio buffer means Mixxx will be "
"more responsive, but requires a faster CPU and quality audio interface. "
"Setting your audio buffer too small may be too much for your computer and "
"audio interface to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy "
"and very clearly distorted as your system will not be able to keep up with "
"how frequently Mixxx is trying to process audio. It is recommended to set "
"your audio buffer as small as your system can handle reliably without "
"glitches. Experiment with different audio buffer sizes to find what works "
"for your system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:50
msgid ""
"An audio buffer between 23-64 ms is acceptable if you are using Mixxx with a"
" keyboard/mouse or a controller. An audio buffer below 10 ms is recommended "
"when vinyl control is used because Mixxx will feel unresponsive otherwise."

"The `Adjusting Audio Latency "

"Your system may glitch only occasionally if you have your audio buffer set a"
" little too low. This will happen at unpredictable times and you may not "

msgid "Sample Rate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:70
msgid ""
"The sample rate setting in Mixxx controls how many samples (chunks of audio)"
" per second are produced by Mixxx. This determines the maximum frequency in "
"Mixxx's signal, which is half the sample rate. Humans can only hear up to 20"
" kHz, so there is generally no need to use more than a 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) "
"sample rate for playback. Most music is published with a 44100 Hz sample "
"rate, and playing music in a different sample rate than the audio file "
"slightly reduces sound quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:78
msgid ""
"A sample rate of 96 kHz gives your computer less than half the time to as to"
" do the same processing. Increasing the sample rate will increase CPU usage "
"and likely raise the minimum audio buffer size you can use reliably."

"The Sound :term:`API` that Mixxx uses is the method by which Mixxx talks to "
"your :term:`operating system` in order to deliver audio to your audio "
"interface. Your choice of Sound API can drastically affect Mixxx's "
"performance on your computer. **Therefore it is important to take care to "
"choose the best Sound API available to you.**"

"It is best to use the ASIO Sound API that bypassses the sound processing of "

"an ASIO driver available, but audio interfaces built into computers and very"
" cheap audio interfaces typically do not have an ASIO driver. If there is no"

"JACK allows you to route audio between JACK-compatible applications in "

"However, JACK can be complicated to set up. Unless you will be connecting "
"Mixxx to other JACK-compatible applications, JACK offers no advantages over "
"ALSA. To use JACK, start the JACK daemon *before* running Mixxx. Otherwise "
"JACK will not appear as a Sound API in the preferences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:133
msgid ""
"Most modern GNU/Linux distributions use PulseAudio by default. When launched"
" from a GUI menu entry or icon, Mixxx suspends PulseAudio while it is "
"running so that Mixxx can use ALSA directly. Like JACK, PulseAudio allows "
"multiple programs to access one audio interface, but PulseAudio and JACK "
"have opposite design goals. PulseAudio is designed to make ordinary computer"
" usage such as watching videos online and listening to music easy whereas "
"JACK is designed for demanding low latency audio programs like Mixxx. It can"
" be difficult to setup JACK and PulseAudio to work well together. So, unless"
" you already use JACK, it is easiest to let Mixxx suspend PulseAudio and use"
" ALSA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences/sound_hardware.rst:143
msgid ""
"If the PulseAudio plugin for alsalibs is installed on GNU/Linux, you can "
"choose the virtual device ``pulse``. This allows Mixxx to share the default "
"system audio interface with other media players. This only works if you "
"start Mixxx without pasuspender, which you can do by running "
":command:`mixxx` from a console rather than clicking the launcher icon in a "
"menu or on your desktop. Since the sound stream is routed from ALSA to Pulse"
" and back to ALSA, this adds an additional latency of ~2 x the selected "
"audio buffer size."

"**Multi-Soundcard Synchronization**: Mixxx is able to use two or more "

"**Main Output Mode**: In Mono mode, the left and right channel are combined "
