"The Vestax VCI-400 is a 4 deck controller. It has an integrated audio "
"interface with balanced outputs (XLR and 1/4\" TRS), two pairs of RCA "
"inputs, and two XLR / 1/4\" combination microphone inputs. The microphone "
"inputs can be sent to the computer for recording and broadcasting. The RCA "
"inputs do not have phono preamps and do not work for vinyl control. The "
"VCI-400 requires its own power supply; it does not run on USB bus power."

"The original VCI-400 firmware has a bug that prevents the sound card from "
"working with Linux. Now that Vestax is out of business, drivers and firmware"
" for Vestax devices are hosted on `Serato’s website "
"<https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/articles/203593924-Vestax-Hardware-"
"Drivers-and-Firmware>`__. If your VCI-400’s sound card does not appear as an"
" available device using Linux, use the firmware updater on a computer "
"running Windows or Mac OS X. This will only need to be done once and then "
"the controller will continue to work with Linux."
