"The Hercules DJControl Compact is a simple controller for basic two-channel "
"mixing. This device does not have a built in sound card, so it would require"
" a :ref:`splitter cable <hardware-splitter-cables>` or :ref:`separate audio "
"interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` to be able to preview tracks in "
"headphones. It also does not have buttons for routing decks to headphones."
