"Vinyl control allows a user to manipulate the playback of a track in Mixxx "
"using a real turntable as a controller. In effect, it simulates the sound "
"and feel of having your digital music collection on vinyl. Many DJs prefer "
"the tactile feel of vinyl, and vinyl control allows that feel to be "
"preserved while retaining the benefits of using digital audio."

#: ../../chapters/vinyl_control.rst:22
msgid ""
"Vinyl control uses special :term:`timecode` records or CD's which are placed"
" on real turntables or :term:`CDJ`. The audio output of the turntables is "
"plugged into a audio interface connected to a computer on which Mixxx is "
"running. When a record is played on one of the attached turntables, Mixxx "
"reads the timecode from the record and uses the information to manipulate "
"whatever track is loaded."

"It is possible to use Mixxx's vinyl control with a variety of setups. Unlike"

"together with timecode control. The basic setups for timecode control are:"

"using your deck in relative mode, with one exception. If you drop the needle"
" in the :guilabel:`Lead-in Time` area (see `Vinyl Configuration`_), Mixxx "
"will seek back to the beginning of the track.  Once a track is playing in "
"Relative Mode, Mixxx will not allow you to select Absolute mode. Otherwise, "

"stopped and then you're free to select Absolute mode."
