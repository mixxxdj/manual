"The Reloop Beatmix 4 is a performance-oriented 4-channel pad controller with"
" integrated soundcard. It offers an ergonomically designed 4-channel mixer "
"layout, optimized for the club allowing you to work intuitively: Dedicated "
"equalizer and gain dials, high-quality line-faders, an extremely smooth-"
"running crossfader, 16 multi-colour drum pads, as well as two extensive FX "
"units are the foundation for your creativity."
