msgid ""
"The Numark iDJ Live II is a budget MIDI controller similar to the `Discover "
"DJ <ion-discover-dj>`. It does not have a built in sound card, so a "
":ref:`splitter cable <hardware-splitter-cables>` or a :ref:`separate audio "
"interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` is required to use headphones with "
"it."

"Most of the mapping is self-explanatory and matches up to labels in the "
"Mixxx :term:`GUI`. The mapping script only handles the jog wheels and "
"scratch button, so you can remap everything else using the learning wizard "
"if you'd like."

"The scratch button in the middle changes the mode of the jog wheels. When "
"the scratch LED is off, you can use the wheels to adjust the pitch of a "
"playing track, or to quickly search through a paused track. The search mode "
"moves exactly 32 beats for each revolution of the jog wheel."
