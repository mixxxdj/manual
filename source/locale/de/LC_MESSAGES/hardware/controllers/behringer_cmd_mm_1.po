"The Behringer CMD MM-1 is a flexible controller that controls 4 decks by "
"default. The mapping can be easily configured to control any combination of "
"decks and effect units. The Behringer CMD DC-1 and Behringer CMD DV-1 are "
"designed to be used together with the CMD MM-1, but the CMD MM-1 can be used"
" alone or with other controllers (especially the :ref:`Novation Launchpad "
