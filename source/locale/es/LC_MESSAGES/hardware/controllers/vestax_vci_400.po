"The Vestax VCI-400 is a 4 deck controller. It has an integrated audio "
"interface with balanced outputs (XLR and 1/4\" TRS), two pairs of RCA "
"inputs, and two XLR / 1/4\" combination microphone inputs. The microphone "
"inputs can be sent to the computer for recording and broadcasting. The RCA "
"inputs do not have phono preamps and do not work for vinyl control. The "
"VCI-400 requires its own power supply; it does not run on USB bus power."
