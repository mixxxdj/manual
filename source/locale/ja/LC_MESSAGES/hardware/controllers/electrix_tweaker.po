"The Electrix Tweaker is an unconventional MIDI controller that can control "
"most aspects of Mixxx. Instead of jog wheels, it fits an 8x4 grid of "
"multicolor backlit buttons, 8 velocity-sensitive buttons, and 6 push "
"encoders with LED rings into a relatively small package. It does not have a "
"built in sound card, so it requires a separate sound card or splitter cable "
"(although it does include 5-pin MIDI in and out ports)."
