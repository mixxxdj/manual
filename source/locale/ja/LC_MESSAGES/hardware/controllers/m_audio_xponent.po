"This device has been discontinued. M-Audio discontinued its DJ products "
"after the company was bought by inMusic in 2012. This device is a class "
"compliant USB audio and MIDI device, so it does not require a special driver"
" on any OS that Mixxx runs on."

"Typically, the ASIO sound API is the best option on Windows and it requires "
"an ASIO driver from the sound card manufacturer. However, it seems that the "
"current version of the Xponent ASIO driver for Windows interferes with the "
"ability to send MIDI control messages to the Xponent. As a result, if you "
"are running M-Audio’s Xponent ASIO drivers on Windows, the lights will not "
"work. If you uninstall the drivers, the lights will work, but you can no "
"longer use the Xponent’s sound card with the ASIO sound API."

"It is recommended to **use the WDM-KS sound API** instead. The sound card "
"will appear as “Analog Connector 1 (Xponent Audio)” and “Analog Connector 2 "
"(Xponent Audio)”. Connector 2 is the main out, and Connector 1 is the "
"headphones. The latency meter seems to run a bit higher than it did under "
"ASIO, so keep this in mind, and test both setups with your own system to see"
" how they compare. If you require low latency as well as a lot of effects or"
" time stretching, you may want to run with the ASIO driver at the expense of"
" the lights."
