msgid ""
"This section describes how to use the standard Mixxx mapping for effects "

"encoder) and 4 buttons for effects. It allows you to switch between "
"controlling all 3 effects of a chain or controlling each parameter of one "
"effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/effects.rst:188
msgid ""
"By default, 3 knobs are used for controlling effect metaknobs and the "
"buttons under them toggle each effect on/off. To temporarily toggle an "
"effect on/off, press and hold an effect enable button. The 4th knob is used "
"for the mix (dry/wet) knob of the whole chain. On controllers designed for "
"Serato, the :guilabel:`Beats` encoder is used as the mix knob."

"The button next to the mix knob is used for focusing effects. On controllers"

"The LED of the focus button indicates whether any effect is focused. When "
"its LED is on, you can hold the button down to see which effect is focused "

"you short press the focus button again, the previously focused effect will "
"be refocused (it is not remembered when you shut down Mixxx though)."

"Alternatively, if you want to keep all the parameters showing on screen, you"
