msgid "Mixxx can be controlled with a keyboard, a mouse, :term:`MIDI`/:term:`HID` controllers, time-code records/CDs, or a combination of these. The choice usually depends on your budget or style of DJing."

#: ../../chapters/controlling_mixxx.rst:21
msgid "**Single Left Click**: Performing a left mouse click on buttons triggers the default action for that control. Moreover if you click on a value in the track list of the Mixxx :ref:`library <library-interface>`, you can change the value. For example the year of a track."

msgid "**Double Left Click**: Double-click on any knob or fader to reset it to its default value. This is especially useful on touchscreens as executing a right-click on them is usually tedious."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/controlling_mixxx.rst:28
msgid "**Single Right Click**: On most buttons, performing a right click triggers a different action than a left click. You can return any knob or fader to its default value by right-clicking that control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/controlling_mixxx.rst:31
msgid "**Mouse Drag**: Click on a knob or fader, hold the left mouse button and move your cursor to change the value of the control. Use mouse drag to drop tracks from the file list to the decks, crates, playlists, etc."

#: ../../chapters/controlling_mixxx.rst:34
msgid "**Mouse Wheel**: Just like Mouse Drag, you can change knob and fader values by placing the cursor over the control and moving the mouse wheel."
