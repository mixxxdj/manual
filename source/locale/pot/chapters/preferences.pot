msgid "Audio Buffer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:38
msgid "The audio buffer is the amount of audio in milliseconds that Mixxx processes at a time. This is a major factor that determines the latency between changing controls in Mixxx such as moving the crossfader or pressing the play button and hearing the audio change. For example, with an audio buffer of 23 ms, it will take approximately 23 milliseconds for Mixxx to stop the audio after you toggle the play button. The actual latency will be longer depending on a variety of factors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:46
msgid "The audio buffer setting determines how quickly your :term:`operating system` expects Mixxx to react. A smaller audio buffer means Mixxx will be more responsive, but requires a faster CPU and quality audio interface. Setting your audio buffer too small may be too much for your computer and audio interface to handle. In this situation, Mixxx playback will be choppy and very clearly distorted as your system will not be able to keep up with how frequently Mixxx is trying to process audio. It is recommended to set your audio buffer as small as your system can handle reliably without glitches. Experiment with different audio buffer sizes to find what works for your system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:56

msgid "Your system may glitch only occasionally if you have your audio buffer set a little too low. This will happen at unpredictable times and you may not notice if you are only doing brief tests of each audio buffer size.

msgid "Sample Rate"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:76
msgid "The sample rate setting in Mixxx controls how many samples (chunks of audio) per second are produced by Mixxx. This determines the maximum frequency in Mixxx's signal, which is half the sample rate. Humans can only hear up to 20 kHz, so there is generally no need to use more than a 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) sample rate for playback. Most music is published with a 44100 Hz sample rate, and playing music in a different sample rate than the audio file slightly reduces sound quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:84
msgid "A sample rate of 96 kHz gives your computer less than half the time to as to do the same processing. Increasing the sample rate will increase CPU usage and likely raise the minimum audio buffer size you can use reliably."

Check the manufacturer's website to see if a driver download is available. Soundcards designed for musicians almost always have an ASIO driver available, but audio interfaces built into computers and very cheap audio interfaces typically do not have an ASIO driver. If there is no ASIO driver available for your audio interface, use the WDM-KS API. There is generally no advantage to using `ASIO4ALL <http://www.asio4all.org>`_, a wrapper around the WDM-KS API."

Unless you will be connecting Mixxx to other JACK-compatible applications, JACK offers no advantages over ALSA. To use JACK, start the JACK daemon *before* running Mixxx. Otherwise JACK will not appear as a Sound API in the preferences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:139
msgid "Most modern GNU/Linux distributions use PulseAudio by default. When launched from a GUI menu entry or icon, Mixxx suspends PulseAudio while it is running so that Mixxx can use ALSA directly. Like JACK, PulseAudio allows multiple programs to access one audio interface, but PulseAudio and JACK have opposite design goals. PulseAudio is designed to make ordinary computer usage such as watching videos online and listening to music easy whereas JACK is designed for demanding low latency audio programs like Mixxx. It can be difficult to setup JACK and PulseAudio to work well together. So, unless you already use JACK, it is easiest to let Mixxx suspend PulseAudio and use ALSA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/preferences.rst:149
msgid "If the PulseAudio plugin for alsalibs is installed on GNU/Linux, you can choose the virtual device ``pulse``. This allows Mixxx to share the default system audio interface with other media players. This only works if you start Mixxx without pasuspender, which you can do by running :command:`mixxx` from a console rather than clicking the launcher icon in a menu or on your desktop. Since the sound stream is routed from ALSA to Pulse and back to ALSA, this adds an additional latency of ~2 x the selected audio buffer size."
