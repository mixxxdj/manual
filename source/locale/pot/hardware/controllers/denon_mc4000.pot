msgid "The microphone and auxiliary inputs are mixed with the master output in hardware. They are not available to the computer through the MC4000’s sound card, so this controller’s sound card is not suitable for broadcasting or recording the inputs. You could use the controller with a separate USB sound card that has a microphone input for that purpose."
