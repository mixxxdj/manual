msgid "The sound card has 2 RCA jacks for the main output. There are two headphone jacks, one small (1/8“) and one large (1/4”) connector (each jack plays the same channels, they cannot be used for independent signals). There is a 1/4\" microphone input with an adjustable gain knob. The microphone input is mixed directly with the main RCA outputs in hardware. It is not available to the computer, so cannot record or broadcast with the microphone input on the controller. You could use the controller with a separate USB :ref:`audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` that has a microphone input for that purpose. The microphone preamplifier is very noisy, so it is recommended to keep the microphone gain knob all the way down when not using a microphone, otherwise there will be noise added to the main RCA outputs."
