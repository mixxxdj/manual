"The ION Discover DJ is a cheap budget MIDI controller meant to “discover DJ-"
"ing” for people with a potential interest. It does not have a built in sound"
" card, so a :ref:`splitter cable <hardware-splitter-cables>` or "
":ref:`separate audio interface <hardware-audio-interfaces>` is required to "
"use headphones with it."
