#: ../../manual_guidelines.rst:16
msgid ""
"Easy to use when, where, and how you need it. Watch how someone else uses "
"the application. Watch them look for information in the manual (preferably "
"someone who has never seen it before). Be consistent with the instructional "
"design so users can follow a set pattern. Don't use software development "

"For example users should actually learn from it, not just refer to it. Use "

"Group problems the user might hit in a particular task right there with the "
