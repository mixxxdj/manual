"The Reloop Jockey 3 Master Edition is a 2 Channel Controller with the option"
" to control 4 Channels. It has a built-in sound card with 6 channels in and "
"4 channels out. It features both balanced 1/4\" and unbalanced RCA main "
"outputs plus RCA booth outputs with an independent volume control. It can "
"also be used as a stand-alone mixer, or used to mix an analog source with "
"music files in Mixxx. This device requires a power adapter in addition to "
"the USB cable."
