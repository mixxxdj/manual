"The pitch on the controller has a very short run. Thus, having it configured"

"The autolooping functions, although implemented are quite flawed. The “loop "
"one bar”, which is present since the 1.0b version, is making a loop between "
"two bars, which are rarely fitted on real “measures”. As of mixxx 1.9, there"

"tempo"

"Final remark on the hardware design: be very, very careful not to press the "

"button. They are very near, the error is easy and produces the most dire "
"effect in a party: an awful blank !"
