"In order for this mapping to work, you will need to use these settings. "
"First, enter *System Mode* by pressing the two black buttons in the top "
"right encoder section. There is a vertical *System* label next to these two "
"buttons. The orange *Sys/Mon* LED in the center bottom should be on and not "
"blinking."

"You can now modify various settings by pressing each of the 4 black buttons "
"of the encoder section. There are two possible settings for each function, "
"*On* or *Off*, depending which of the corresponding LED is lit. There is "
"also a brief explanation of these settings on a gray sticker in the back of "
"the controller."

"The top left button controls the *Auto Switch* function. If the "

"encoder will switch to *Seek/Scratch* after pressing the encoder to load a "
