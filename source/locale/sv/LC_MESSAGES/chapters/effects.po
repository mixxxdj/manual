msgid ""
"This section describes how to use the standard Mixxx mapping for effects "

"controlling all 3 effects of a chain or controlling each parameter of one "
"effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/effects.rst:188
msgid ""
"By default, 3 knobs are used for controlling effect metaknobs and the "
"buttons under them toggle each effect on/off. To temporarily toggle an "
"effect on/off, press and hold an effect enable button. The 4th knob is used "
"for the mix (dry/wet) knob of the whole chain. On controllers designed for "
"Serato, the :guilabel:`Beats` encoder is used as the mix knob."

"The LED of the focus button indicates whether any effect is focused. When "
"its LED is on, you can hold the button down to see which effect is focused "

"you short press the focus button again, the previously focused effect will "
"be refocused (it is not remembered when you shut down Mixxx though)."

"Alternatively, if you want to keep all the parameters showing on screen, you"
