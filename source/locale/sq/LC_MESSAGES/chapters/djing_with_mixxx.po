"**If a level meter is in its red region, the signal is clipping and the gain"

"unpleasant way and can damage equipment by driving it with more power than "
"it is designed to handle. Increasing the gain past the point where clipping "
"begins (further into the red on a meter) will distort the signal more. If "

"On the other hand, the signal should not be too low. This is because every "
"audio device generates a little noise at a level referred to as its noise "
"floor. Additionally, analog signals pick up noise as they travel along "
"wires. The signal measured by the meter on the left is relatively close to "
"the noise floor. When a device is turned up, the noise floor does not go up;"
" only the signal does. However, every time the signal is amplified by the "
"gain of another piece of equipment, both the noise and the signal from "
"previous devices in the signal chain are amplified. For example, if your "
"sound card is turned down and you turn the gain up on your mixer to "
"compensate, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the sound card output will be"
" low and the mixer's gain will amplify the signal and the noise from the "
"sound card, plus the noise picked up along the wire. The end result will "
"have more noise than if the output of the sound card was turned up before "
"the signal reached the mixer and the mixer's gain did not have to be turned "

":term:`Beatmatching<beatmatching>` is the process of adjusting the playback "

"beatmatch."

" the tempo of the two tracks must be synchronized by adjusting the playback "
"rate sliders. You can adjust the phase of the beats by right-clicking and "
"dragging on either waveform display to temporarily speed up or slow down one"
" of the tracks until the beats are aligned. The temporary pitch bend buttons"
" can also be used to momentarily adjust the playback rate, allowing you to "

" open and listen for the beats drifting out of alignment. This has a "
"distinct “double bass kick” sound which is often preceded by the kick "
"weakening in intensity as the two kicks drift out of phase. When this "
