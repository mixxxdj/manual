"If you are upgrading from an older version of Mixxx and have MP3 files in "
"your library, we have another important announcement. The good news is that "
"we fixed a bug where the waveforms and audio playback of MP3 files were "
"misaligned. The bad news is that we have no way of knowing which MP3 files "
"were affected or how much the offset was. That means that waveforms, "
"beatgrids, cues, and loops from older versions of Mixxx may be offset by an "
"unknown amount for any MP3 file. Only MP3 files were affected by this bug; "
"other audio file types are unaffected. You can either correct your beatgrids"
" and cue points manually for each track, or you can clear this information "
"for all MP3s and start fresh. Regardless, we recommend clearing the "
"waveforms for all MP3 files. To clear these, type \"location:mp3\" into the "
"library search bar, press Control + A to select all tracks, right click, and"
