"The American Audio VMS2 is a 2-deck all-in-one controller. It is a USB class"
" compliant MIDI and audio device that works with GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and "
"Windows. It features a 4 channel input and 4 channel output sound card with "
"2 phono preamps. The main output has XLR and RCA outputs (do not use both at"
" once). There is a separate RCA booth output. The VMS2 can also be used as a"
" stand-alone mixer with analog sources without a computer by setting the "
"USB/Analog switches on the front of the device to “Analog”."

"Mixxx’s Deck 1/2 outputs are affected by the Mixxx software EQs. However, "
"the VMS2’s volume faders and crossfader (as well as the headphone buttons) "
"control the VMS2’s hardware mixer and do not affect Mixxx’s Deck 1 and Deck "
"2 output signals. Therefore, a recording using the Mixxx software will sound"
" different from what is played through the VMS2 main output, as the "
"crossfader curve and signal mixing are not the same in hardware and "
"software. If you require a recording that captures exactly what the audience"
" will hear, use a separate soundcard and recording software to record from "
