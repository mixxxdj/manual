"Mixxx enables you to perform live DJ mixes with your digital music "
"collection. It helps you rock the party with DJ controllers, vinyl "
"turntables, or even just your keyboard. It is developed by an international "
"team of volunteers who want to bring the joy of DJing to everyone. The "
"project is non-profit, open-source and community driven. Together, we aim to"
" build the best DJ software ever created. We hope you will :ref:`join us "
"<contributing>`!"

msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/introduction.rst:19
msgid ""
"Mixxx is different from typical music player applications because it plays "
"multiple audio files at the same time and has many features to manipulate "
"the playback of the audio files. This lets you creatively mix different "
"tracks together on the fly."

#: ../../chapters/introduction.rst:24
msgid ""
"You can use Mixxx to preview the next track in headphones before the "
"audience hears it, also known as headphone cueing. This helps you choose a "
"track that is appropriate for the present moment and that will mix well into"
" the currently playing track(s). To use headphone cueing, you need at least "
"2 separate audio outputs, typically provided by a USB audio interface (also "
"known as a “sound card”, although most of them are not shaped like cards "
"anymore). Mixxx can be used in two different ways for headphone cueing:"

#: ../../chapters/introduction.rst:34
msgid ""
"Mixxx plays multiple audio files on the computer at the same time, mixes "
"them together, and sends the mixed signal to one audio interface output. A "
"separate signal is sent to another audio interface output for headphone "
"cueing. Often a DJ controller is used with internal mixing to provide easier"
" control over Mixxx than a mouse and keyboard."

msgid "**External Mixing**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapters/introduction.rst:54
msgid ""
"In this kind of setup, Mixxx plays multiple audio files on the computer at "
"the same time and sends each track to a separate audio interface output. The"
" audio interface's outputs are plugged into an external hardware mixer. The "
"hardware mixer performs the actual mixing of the audio signals. On the "
"hardware mixer, there are separate outputs for the mixed signal to play to "
"the audience and for the DJ to use headphone cueing. External mixing is "
"typically used with turntables and :ref:`special vinyl records<vinyl-"
"control>` to manipulate digital music files as if the music was on the vinyl"
" records."
