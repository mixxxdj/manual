            and beatmap options.

Mixxx uses an ultra-precise BPM and beat detector. Manual adjustments
are redundant in many cases because Mixxx knows where the beats are.

BPM and beat detection is a complex operation. Depending on your computer and
the track's bitrate and duration this may take some time. By default Mixxx
analyzes the complete track. To accelerate beat detection on slower computers, a
“Fast Analysis” option is available. If enabled, the BPM is computed by
analyzing the first minute of the track. In most cases this does not affect the
beat detection negatively because most of today's dance music is written in a
4/4 signature with a fixed tempo.

   Mixxx preferences - BPM settings

The table below summarizes the beat detection settings:

+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Option                                | Description                          |
+=======================================+======================================+
| Enable Fast Analysis                  | If enabled, BPM will be detected by  |
|                                       | only using the first minute of audio.|
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Assume constant tempo                 | If enabled, Mixxx assumes that the   |
|                                       | distances between the beats are      |
|                                       | constant. If disabled, the raw beat  |
|                                       | grid obtained by the analyzer is     |
|                                       | presented. The latter is appropriate |
|                                       | for tracks with variable tempo.      |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Enable Offset Correction              | Prevents beat markers from being     |
|                                       | placed incorrectly.                  |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Re-analyze beats when settings        | If enabled, Mixxx over-writes old    |

| outdated                              | Moreover, it will re-analyze the BPM |
|                                       | if your beat detection preferences   |
|                                       | change or BPM data from 3rd party    |
|                                       | programs are present.                |

Correcting Beat Grids
---------------------

There may be situations where BPM and beat detection do not result in a proper
beat grid.

Typically, the detected BPM is correct but the analyzer has failed to detect the
location of the first beat. Consequently, the beat markers are shifted, i.e.
the beat markers are a fixed distance from the true beat. To adjust the
beat grid, cue the track before a real beat and click the :guilabel:`Beat-grid
Adjust` button in the :ref:`interface-button-grid`.

If the detected BPM is not accurate, the corresponding beat grid will also be
inaccurate. A deviation of 0.02 BPM units from the correct BPM will cause
beatgrid alignment issues on long tracks (e.g. a club mix). If this happens,
your beatgrid may look aligned for the few minutes but you will notice a slight
drift as the song goes on. Finding the correct BPM is easy in many cases - just
follow the note below.

.. note:: If the detected BPM value is not sufficiently accurate but very close
          to an integer value, try to set the BPM value manually to the integer.
