Key Detection
=============

Mixxx comes with a high precision musical key detector to help you make smooth
mixes by ensuring that your tracks are musically compatible.

Analyzer Settings
-----------------

Key detection is a complex operation. Depending on your computer and the track's
bitrate and duration this may take some time. By default Mixxx analyzes the
complete track. To accelerate key detection on slower computers, a “Fast
Analysis” option is available. If enabled, the key is computed by analyzing the
first minute of the track.
