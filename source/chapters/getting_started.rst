Getting Started
***************

Installing Mixxx
================
After `downloading Mixxx from our Website <https://mixxx.org/download/>`_, you need
to install it on your computer.

 **Windows**
   Double-click the Mixxx installation file and go through the installation wizard.

 **macOS**
   Double-click the Mixxx .dmg file and drag the Mixxx icon to your Applications
   folder.

 **GNU/Linux**
   No steps are necessary after you follow the instructions on the download
   page.

Upgrading Mixxx
===============

.. sectionauthor::
   Owen Williams <owilliams@mixxx.org>

You may safely install Mixxx on top of any previous version. You don't need to
uninstall the old version.

Your settings and library will not be removed or reset, but they may be upgraded
when you launch the new version of Mixxx. Note that we do not guarantee that new
configurations will work on older versions of Mixxx, therefore you may want to
make a backup of your existing settings just in case.

 **Windows**
   Mixxx settings are in :file:`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Mixxx`, which is usually
   something like :file:`c:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Mixxx`. If you have
   trouble finding this folder, see `these instructions
   <https://www.howtogeek.com/318177/what-is-the-appdata-folder-in-windows/>`_.

  **macOS**
    Mixxx settings are in :file:`/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/org.mixxx.mixxx/Data/Library/Application Support/Mixxx`

  **GNU/Linux**
    Mixxx settings are in :file:`/home/<username>/.mixxx`

Copy this directory to a backup drive or somewhere else on your system to make a
backup of your settings.

.. seealso:: For detailed descriptions of the settings files, go to :ref:`appendix-settings-files`.

Opening Mixxx
=============
|logo| Once you've installed Mixxx, start by
opening Mixxx and importing your music to the Mixxx library.

**Windows**
  Double-click the Mixxx icon on the Desktop. Alternatively, browse your Windows
  start menu and click the Mixxx icon, or perform a search for
  :file:`Mixxx.exe`.

**macOS**
  Double-click the Mixxx icon in the :file:`Applications` folder. Alternatively,
  drag the Mixxx icon to the dock and double-click it there or search for
  :command:`mixxx` in Spotlight.

**GNU/Linux**
  Click the Mixxx icon in the applications menu or launcher of your desktop
  environment or perform a search for :file:`mixxx`. Alternatively type
  :command:`mixxx` into the terminal, then hit :kbd:`Return`.
  If your :term:`audio interface` is not accessible from Mixxx because it is
  used by other applications via PulseAudio, you may close and restart Mixxx
  using :command:`pasuspender mixxx`. See :ref:`appendix-command-line-options`
  for an overview of Mixxx's command line options.

Importing your audio files
==========================

   :alt: Mixxx 1st run - Choose music library directory dialog
   :figclass: pretty-figures

   Mixxx running on Windows 10 - Choose music library directory dialog

The first time you run Mixxx, you are asked to select a directory where your
music is stored. By default, the dialog points to a location where music files
are typically held, but you can select any location on your computer.

Click :guilabel:`Select Folder` and Mixxx will scan your music library.
Depending on the size of your library this could take some time. All the
supported music files Mixxx detects will be listed in the :ref:`library-tracks`.

If you want to refresh your library (for example because you added or moved
files), you can do this with :menuselection:`Library --> Rescan Library` in
the menu. If you want to rescan at every launch, select
:menuselection:`Preferences --> Library --> Rescan on startup`.

.. warning :: On Windows 7 and 8 the import dialog points to your Windows
              “Music“ Library, a special-purpose virtual folder. You can
              **not** use these virtual folders. Select a regular folder
              instead, usually “My Music“, like pictured above.

.. _getting-started-analyze-library:

Analyze your library
====================

.. sectionauthor::
   RJ Ryan <rryan@mixxx.org>
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_prepare| Mixxx automatically analyzes tracks the first time you load
them in a deck. This allows you to run :term:`beatgrid`, :term:`key`, and :term:`ReplayGain` detection on tracks in advance. It also prepares the waveform overviews, detects file corruption, and calculates the :term:`BPM` values.

.. seealso:: For more information, go to :ref:`configuration-bpm-detection`.

Why you should analyze your audio files
---------------------------------------

If the tracks have never been played with Mixxx before, the library columns :guilabel:`BPM`,
:guilabel:`Duration` and :guilabel:`Key` will be empty or unreliable (because the values are just read from the file's tags if present and might be wrong).
Pre-generating beatgrids gives you the chance to double-check
the beat markers to make sure they are correct. Errors in beatgrids can cause difficulty when syncing tracks.
Furthermore, track analysis takes considerable CPU power and might cause skips in the audio ---
things you surely don't need while performing.

How to analyze your audio files
-------------------------------
Once you have :ref:`imported your music library<getting-started-import-audio-files>`, press
:guilabel:`OK` on the Preferences window.

* Go to the :guilabel:`Analyze` view on the left side panel of the library.
* To analyze a few specific tracks, hold down the :kbd:`Ctrl` button, and select the tracks that you want to analyze or you can :kbd:`shift`-select a range of tracks. Once they've been highlighted, click the :guilabel:`Analyze` button on the top right of the library section.
* To analyze the newly added tracks, toggle the :guilabel:`New` label and then click :guilabel:`Analyze`.
* To analyze the entire library, toggle the :guilabel:`All` label and then click :guilabel:`Analyze`.
* The :guilabel:`New` and :guilabel:`All` toggle buttons are located at the top left of the analysis pane - just above the :guilabel:`Preview` and :guilabel:`Cover Art` column titles of the library.

While analyzing, the progress in percentage and total queue length are shown.

.. _getting-started-sound-io:

Configuring sound input and output
==================================

Before you can start using Mixxx, you need to configure Mixxx to use your
sound hardware in :menuselection:`Preferences --> Sound Hardware`. You do not
need to configure all inputs and outputs.

The :ref:`hardware` chapter explains different types of DJ hardware and how to
set them up with the input and output options. For Mixxx to perform the best
it can on your system, configure the other :ref:`preferences-sound-hardware`
preferences in addition to the inputs and outputs.

   Mixxx Sound Hardware Preferences

Output Options
--------------

**Internal mixing**:

Use these outputs if you are not using an :ref:`external hardware mixer
<hardware-mixers>`. If you are using a controller with a built-in audio
interface, use these outputs.

* *Main*: all decks, samplers, microphones, and auxiliary inputs mixed
  together. This output is sent to the speakers for the audience.
* *Headphones*: all decks, samplers, microphones, and auxiliary inputs
  assigned to :term:`pre-fader listening <PFL>`
* *Booth*: same as main output, but has a separate gain control

**External mixing**:

* *Decks 1-4*: the individual unmixed decks to send to an external mixer
* *Bus Left/Center/Right*: all decks, samplers, and auxiliary inputs
  assigned to each side of Mixxx's :term:`crossfader`

Input Options
-------------
**Internal mixing**:

Use these inputs if you are not using an external hardware mixer. If you are
using a controller with a built-in audio interface, use these inputs.

* *Microphone 1-4*: live microphone or musical instrument inputs
* *Auxiliary 1-4*: other sound sources

**External mixing**:

* *Record/Broadcast*: When this is configured, Mixxx will record and
  broadcast from this audio interface input instead of the internal main output
  mix. If you have a microphone plugged into the mixer, do not configure the
  Microphone 1-4 inputs.

**Either internal or external mixing**:

* *Vinyl Control 1-4*: timecode input from turntables or CDJs for
  manipulating decks 1-4
