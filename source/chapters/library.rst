   The Mixxx Library

The library manages all of your music files. This is where you can find the
tracks you want to play and load them into a :ref:`deck <interface-decks>` or
:ref:`sampler <interface-sampler>`; see :ref:`library-loading-tracks`. Mixxx
imports your music library automatically when it is run for the first time, see
:ref:`configuration-import` for more information.

The sidebar on the left contains different collections of music. The track list
view on the right displays the tracks in those collections.

**Sidebar**:

* **Search**: Search for tracks in your Mixxx library.
* **Tracks**: View and edit your whole collection.
* **Auto DJ**: Automatically load and crossfade tracks for unattended mixing.
* **Playlists**: Arrange tracks in a set order.
* **Crates**: Organize tracks in (unordered) collections.
* **Computer**: Navigate, view, and load tracks from folders on your hard disk
  and connected devices.
* **Recordings**: Record your mix and view previous recordings.
* **History**: Browse lists of tracks played in past mixing sessions.
* **Analyze**: Generate Mixxx-specific data for tracks before a gig.
* **External Libraries**: Access your existing iTunes, Traktor, Rhythmbox, and
  Banshee libraries.

**Track List**:

* **Sort**: Display and sort track collections by different criteria.
* **Load**: Drag tracks you want to play to the waveform display.
* **Edit**: Rate tracks and edit track properties.

Tracks - View and edit your whole collection
============================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_library| A sortable list of all the tracks in your music library.

**Customizing the view**
  Move columns by clicking a column header and dragging it to another
  position. Right-click on a column header to show or hide individual
  columns. Adjust the column width to fit the contents of the rows by
  double-clicking on the separator between two column headers.

**Sorting Tracks**
  Tracks are automatically sorted by the active column. Click on the active
  column header to reverse the sort order. Click on another column header to
  change the active column.

  * **Multi-Column sorting**

    You can sort multiple columns by clicking *up to three* column headers you
    wish to sort your tracks by. This makes searching for tracks in a large list
    more efficient. Clicking twice on a column header will reverse the sort
    order.

    Example:

    #. Click on the :guilabel:`BPM` column header -> list is sorted by BPM
    #. Click on the :guilabel:`Year` column header -> list is sorted by
       year. If year is equal, it is still sorted by the last criteria, e.g. BPM.
    #. Click on the :guilabel:`Genre` column header -> list is sorted by
       genre. If genre is equal, it is still sorted by year. If genre and year
       is equal, then it is sorted by BPM.

  * **Random sorting**

    Click on the :guilabel:`Preview` column header to randomly sort tracks.

  * **Sort keys by circle of fifths**

    Click on the :guilabel:`Key` column header.
    The order starts with *C* at the top, then its relative minor (*a*), then
    adds 1 sharp (*G*), then *G*'s relative minor (*e*), and so adding
    sharps/removing flats around the circle of fifths.
    For :ref:`Lancelot <configuration-key-detection>` notation, it starts with
    *G#m* at the top, which is *1A* in that notation, and proceeds
    alphanumerically (minor keys appear before their relative major keys in this
    case).

**Rating tracks**
  Make sure the :guilabel:`Rating` column is not hidden. Rate tracks by hovering
  over the rating field and clicking the stars.

**Track Inline editing**
  Mixxx reads :term:`metadata` from the tracks to fill the columns of the
  library. Double-click on a field, edit the data, and hit :kbd:`Enter` when you
  are done. Go to the chapter :ref:`edit metadata <library-edit-metadata>` for
  detailed information.

**Loading tracks**
  To load a track into a :ref:`deck <interface-decks>`, you can either drag it
  to the waveform display, use the context menu or use :term:`keyboard shortcuts <shortcut>`. Go to the chapter
  :ref:`library-loading-tracks` for detailed information.

**Importing tracks**
  Mixxx imports your music library automatically when it is run for the first
  time. Go to the chapter :ref:`configuration-import` for detailed information.

**Previewing Tracks**
  To pre-listen to tracks in your headphones without loading them to a regular
  deck, click the |ic_lib_preview_play| icon in the :guilabel:`Preview` column.
  Go to the chapter :ref:`library-previewing-tracks` for detailed information.

**Cover/Album Art**

  Mixxx can display cover art it finds for a track in the library.
  It will search for available cover art in the following places in order and
  will use the first one it finds:

    1. The first image saved in the track's ID3v2/Vorbis :term:`tags<metadata>`
    2. An image file in the track folder (if there is only one image file there.)
    3. :file:`%track-file-base%.jpg` in the track directory for
       :file:`%track-file-base%.mp3`
    4. :file:`%album%.jpg`
    5. :file:`cover.jpg`
    6. :file:`front.jpg`
    7. :file:`album.jpg`
    8. :file:`folder.jpg`

  Mixxx supports the following image types: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp

**Rescan Library**
  If you want to manually refresh your library without exiting (for example
  because you added or moved files) you can do this with :menuselection:`Library
  --> Rescan Library` in the menu at the top of the application window. You can
  prompt an automatic rescan when Mixxx is started under
  :menuselection:`Preferences --> Library --> Rescan on startup`.

  Rescanning the library will add new files to the library and mark tracks
  as missing if the corresponding file has been deleted. It tries to detect
  and relocate missing tracks if files have been renamed or moved into another
  directory.

  Automatically refreshing the metadata of tracks when files have been modified
  by an external application is not supported, yet. In this case you need to
  select the affected tracks and (re-)import their metadata from file tags.

Track list context menu
-----------------------

Right-clicking on selected tracks in the track list reveals the context menu:

* **Add to Auto DJ**: Adds the content of the selection to either the
  :guilabel:`bottom` or :guilabel:`top` of the :ref:`Auto DJ <library-auto-dj>`
  playlist for automatic mixing. The :guilabel:`replace` option deletes the
  Auto DJ queue first, and then fills it with the selected tracks.

* **Load to**:
  Loads a selected file to one of the available
  :ref:`Decks <interface-decks>`, :ref:`Samplers <interface-sampler>` or to the
  :ref:`Preview Deck <interface-preview-deck>`. Alternatively
  simply drag it to the :ref:`interface-waveform`. The number of available decks
  and samplers might differ, depending on the selected skin. Note that you
  can't load multiple files at once.
* **Add to Playlist**: Add selected tracks to an existing playlist, or drag the
  selection to a playlist crate in the sidebar. Choose :guilabel:`Create new
  playlist` to put them into a new playlist.
* **Crates:** The checkbox shows in which existing crates the selection is in.
  Changing the crates selection does not collapse the menu, which allows
  much easier categorization of tracks without going through the menu from
  scratch. Choose :guilabel:`Create new Crate` to put them into a new crate.

* **Metadata**:
    * **Import from File Tags**: If the track's :term:`metadata` changes,
      (e.g. if you used iTunes to edit it,) this option lets you save the new
      values for the selected tracks to the Mixxx library. See
      :ref:`edit metadata <library-edit-metadata>`.
    * **Import from MusicBrainz**: Look up :term:`metadata` online by searching
      the :term:`MusicBrainz` database and apply the search results to your
      tracks. See :ref:`edit metadata <library-edit-metadata>`.
    * **Export to File Tags:** Saves :term:`metadata` to files. Mixxx may wait
      to modify files until they are not loaded to any decks or samplers. If you
      do not see changed metadata in other programs immediately, eject the track
      from all decks and samplers or shutdown Mixxx.

    * **Cover Art**:

      * **Choose New Cover**: Select an image from the file browser as the cover.
      * **Clear Cover**: Delete any cover information saved for this track.
      * **Reload from track/folder**: Reload the cover from the tracks' ID3v2
        :term:`tags <metadata>` or a picture in the track folder if the tags do
        not supply any.

* **Clear**:
    * **BPM and Beatgrid**: Removes the :term:`BPM` and :term:`beatgrid` data
      from the selected tracks in the Mixxx library. After doing this, we
      recommend :ref:`analyzing <library-analyze>` the tracks again.
    * **Play Count**: Marks selected tracks as not played in the current
      session and sets their play counter to zero. The icon in the
      :guilabel:`Played` column changes.
    * **Hotcues**: Clears all saved :term:`hotcues <hotcue>` and
      :ref:`hotcue labels <interface-hotcues>`.
    * **ReplayGain**: Clears all saved :term:`ReplayGain` values.
    * **Waveform**: Clears the saved waveform data from the selected tracks.
      This is useful if a file is overwritten by another file of the same name,
      or was edited externally (e.g. in a waveform editor). To clear the
      waveform cache for all tracks in the library, select
      :menuselection:`Preferences --> Waveforms --> Clear cached Waveforms` .
    * **All**: Clears all of the data above from the Mixxx library database at
      once.

* **Change BPM**:

    * Allows to change the :term:`BPM` to 50%, 66%, 75%, 133,33%, 150%, or
      200% of the BPM set by Mixxx when :ref:`analyzing <library-analyze>`
      the tracks. If many of the detected BPM values are incorrect, you might
      want to adjust the :guilabel:`BPM Range` in the
      :ref:`Analyzer Settings <configuration-bpm-detection>` and re-run the
      analysis.

    * **Lock/Unlock BPM**: Locks/Unlocks the :term:`BPM` of selected tracks so
      you can't edit them in the track properties. The |ic_lib_bpm_unlocked|
      icon next to the track's BPM in the library row is a toggle. Clicking it
      will set the status to "locked", and the icon changes to
      |ic_lib_bpm_locked|.

* **Hide from Library**: Temporarily hides selected tracks from the track list.
  Hidden tracks are listed in the :guilabel:`Hidden Tracks` menu item which is
  explained below.
* **Open in File Browser**: Brings up the selected files in your file manager.
* **Properties**: Similar to inline editing explained above, the properties
  dialog allows you to view and edit metadata such as title, artist, album, and
  view the full file name and path. Note that you can not edit multiple files at
  once.

.. note:: Most of the context menu items are available in file lists of other
          views like Auto DJ, Playlists, and Crates as well.

Missing Tracks
--------------

.. sectionauthor::
   M.Linke <kain88@mixxx.org>
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

The Missing Tracks view is accessible by expanding the Library tree item in the
sidebar. Any tracks that were previously loaded into your library but were
later not found on your drive will appear here.
Mixxx does not automatically delete records of missing tracks so that extra
metadata Mixxx might have (such as hot cues and beat grids) will not be lost
in case the file is replaced.

The features in detail:

* **Select All button**: Selects all tracks in the current view.
* **Purge button**: Purges the selected tracks from the Mixxx library, but does
  not remove them from your computer. This will delete all :term:`metadata`
  Mixxx has for a track.

Hidden Tracks
-------------

.. sectionauthor::
   M.Linke <kain88@mixxx.org>
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

The Hidden Tracks view is accessible by expanding the Library tree item in
the sidebar. Any tracks that were previously loaded into your library but were
later set to be hidden from the library will appear here. Use the
:guilabel:`Hide from Library` context menu item in the
:ref:`tracks <library-tracks>` view to temporarily hide selected tracks.

The features in detail:

* **Select All button**: Selects all tracks in the current view.
* **Purge Button**: Purges the selected tracks from the Mixxx library, but does
  not remove them from your computer. This will delete all :term:`metadata`
  Mixxx has for a track.
* **Unhide Button**: Removes the selected tracks from the
  :guilabel:`Hidden Tracks` view and makes them available in the regular track
  lists again. The tracks will re-appear in every playlist or crate they were
  in before being hidden.

.. seealso:: To learn how to permanently remove tracks from the Mixxx library
             using the :guilabel:`Hidden Tracks` view, see
             :ref:`permanently remove tracks <library-removing-tracks>`.

.. _library-loading-tracks:

Loading Tracks
==============

Tracks can be loaded into a deck in several ways:

* Right-click the :ref:`library track table <library-interface>`: Right-clicking
  on a track in the table will present the options :guilabel:`Load in Deck 1`
  and :guilabel:`Load in Deck 2`, among others. Making either selection will
  load a track into a deck.
* By :ref:`control-keyboard` to load the selected track in the library track
  table. Use keyboard :kbd:`↑` and :kbd:`↓` arrow button to select a track, :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`←`
  to load into Deck 1 and :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`→` to load into Deck 2.
* Drag-and-drop from library track table: Dragging-and-dropping a track from the
  track table onto a waveform display will load the track into that deck.
* Drag-and-drop from deck to deck: Once you've loaded a track to deck, sampler,
  or preview deck, click on the :ref:`track title <interface-track-info>`, :ref:`track artist <interface-track-info>` or cover art and
  drag it to another deck or sampler.
  Note that you can also drop tracks onto Playlists and Crates in the sidebar, as well as into track tables of active Playlists or Crates.
* Drag-and-drop from external file browser: Dragging-and-dropping a track from
  an external file browser directly onto a waveform display in Mixxx will load
  that track. This function also works with some other applications. For
  example, on macOS, dragging-and-dropping a track from iTunes onto one of
  Mixxx's waveform displays will load it into that deck.


.. _library-finding-tracks:

Finding Tracks (Search)
=======================

.. sectionauthor::
   RJ Ryan <rryan@mixxx.org>
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

The search function filters the currently displayed list (e.g. a playlist,
a crate, or even the whole library) for tracks that match your search query.

* Activate the search input field by clicking in it or pressing :kbd:`CTRL` +
  :kbd:`F` (Windows/Linux) or :kbd:`CMD` + :kbd:`F` (Mac).
* Type your search term(s). Mixxx filters the tracks as you type and shows only
  those matching the search term(s). Search terms can include an artist's name,
  a song title, BPM, etc.
* To clear the search string hit :kbd:`ESC` or click the clear button right next
  to the input field.
* Hit :kbd:`TAB` to cycle between the search and the list of results in the
  library. Use the :kbd:`↑` and :kbd:`↓` keys to scroll in the
  list of results.

.. note:: If the search input field has focus, the Mixxx keyboard shortcuts are
          disabled, see :ref:`control-keyboard`.

Using search operators
----------------------

Search operators allow you to form more complex search queries. They allow you
to limit certain search terms to particular properties of your tracks.

Mixxx supports the following filters:

* **Text filtering**: album_artist, album, artist, comment, composer, crate,
  genre, grouping, location, title

* **Numeric filtering**: bitrate, bpm, played, rating, track, year

* **Special filtering**: key, duration, added, dateadded, datetime_added, date_added

  * Supports fuzzy matching of key searches. The following example lists tracks
    with harmonically compatible keys to C# minor.

    ::

       ~key:c#m

    You can combine operators but there's no way to do an “OR” search right now.
    The following example lists all tracks by “Danger” over 3 minutes long that
    are rated 4 or 5.

    ::

       artist:Danger duration:>3m rating:>=4

  * Negative search filters. Use the ``-`` prefix as negation operator. The
    following example would find “hip-hop“ from any year but 1990.

    ::

       genre:hip-hop -year:1990

.. _library-previewing-tracks:

Previewing Tracks
=================

.. sectionauthor::
   M.Linke <kain88@mixxx.org>
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

To pre-listen to a track, activate the :guilabel:`Preview` column in a library
view. Clicking the |ic_lib_preview_play| icon in the library's
:guilabel:`Preview` column loads the selected track into a special :ref:`Preview
Deck <interface-preview-deck>` that will only output sound in the
:ref:`headphones <interface-head-master>` channel. Click the
|ic_lib_preview_pause| icon to stop the playback.

Alternatively, select a track from the track list of the Mixxx library, drag the
track to the waveform view of the :ref:`Preview Deck <interface-preview-deck>`
and click the :guilabel:`Play` button next to the waveform.

To display the :ref:`Preview Deck <interface-preview-deck>`,
press :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`4` (Windows/Linux) or :kbd:`CMD` + :kbd:`4` (Mac).

.. hint:: Click on the :guilabel:`Preview` column header to randomly sort tracks.

.. _library-edit-metadata:

Edit metadata of audio files
============================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

Mixxx reads relevant :term:`metadata` from the tracks and displays them in the
library columns. You are free to edit most metadata, and Mixxx offers a number
of different ways to do so. Note that some information can not be edited, such
as bitrate, size, length, type, filename, and location.

.. note:: Mixxx does not support editing the metadata of many tracks at a time
          (bulk editing).

.. warning:: Mixxx won't touch your audio files by default. Changes to a track's
             metadata will be saved to the Mixxx library, but **not** to the
             track itself.

             If you wish to write modified track metadata from the library into
             file tags, check the box in :menuselection:`Preferences -->
             Library --> Track Metadata Synchronisation`.

Manual Edit
-----------

**Track Inline editing**:
  Double-click on a field in the :ref:`library <library-tracks>`. If the field is
  editable, it will become an editable text box. Enter a value and hit
  :kbd:`Enter` when you are done.

     Mixxx library - Properties editor

  * **OK**: Accept the changes and close the editor.
  * **Apply**: Accept the changes and leave the editor open.
  * **Cancel**: Discard the changes and close the editor.
  * **Previous/Next**: Load the previous or next track in the current library
    view.
  * **Import Metadata from File**: Prompts Mixxx to re-read the metadata
    of the selected track (such as when you have modified it externally with
    another application.)
  * **Import Metadata from MusicBrainz**:
    Look up metadata on-line by searching the :term:`MusicBrainz` database. See
    below.

Using the MusicBrainz online database
-------------------------------------

`MusicBrainz <https://musicbrainz.org/>`_ is an :term:`open-source` music
encyclopedia that collects music :term:`metadata` and makes it available to the
public.

  .. figure:: ../_static/Mixxx-200-Library-MusicBrainz-Wizard.png
     :align: center
     :width: 100%
     :figwidth: 66%
     :alt: Mixxx library - MusicBrainz Wizard
     :figclass: pretty-figures

     Mixxx library - MusicBrainz Wizard

The MusicBrainz wizard in Mixxx allows searching the MusicBrainz database and
applying the results to your tracks.

Click on a **single track** in the library and select :guilabel:`Get Metadata
from MusicBrainz`. Mixxx fetches track data from the MusicBrainz database and
displays the search results.

Select the best match from the search results by clicking on it in the list.

  * **Apply**: Apply the selected MusicBrainz metadata to the track.
  * **Close**: Close the wizard.
  * **Previous/Next**: Load the previous or next track in the current library
    view and perform a MusicBrainz lookup on it as well.

Fetching track metadata from MusicBrainz can fail:
  * if Mixxx is unable to find the specified track in the MusicBrainz database,
  * if Mixxx cannot reach the MusicBrainz servers (if they are down),
  * or if you are not connected to the Internet.

.. hint:: The MusicBrainz service has been designed for identifying full audio
   files. If a track is less than 2 minutes long, identifying the file will
   likely fail. Identifying a layered mix-track or mash-up may produce false
   positives in the result list.

Using third-party software
--------------------------

If you have modified file metadata in third-party software, select
:menuselection:`Library --> Rescan Library` in the menu on top of the
application window. This prompts Mixxx to re-read the metadata from **all**
tracks in the library.

Popular software to edit metadata of audio files include:
  * `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.html>`_ (Windows)
  * `Kid3 <https://kid3.sourceforge.io/>`_ (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  * `Picard <https://picard.musicbrainz.org/>`_ (Mac, Windows, Linux)

.. _library-auto-dj:

Auto DJ - Automate your mix
===========================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_autodj| The Auto DJ queue is a special playlist that contains extra
controls for automatic mixing. This is useful when taking a break from live
mixing or for using Mixxx as media player.

The Auto DJ features in detail:

* **Shuffle button**: Randomizes the order of tracks in the Auto DJ playlist.
* **Add Random button**: Adds a random track from track sources (crates) to the
  Auto DJ queue. If no track sources are configured, the track is added from the
  library instead.
* **Skip track button**: Skips the next track in the Auto DJ playlist.
* **Fade now button**: Triggers the transition to the next track.
* **Transition time spin-box**: Determines the duration of the transition. A
  negative value will add a pause between tracks.
* **Selection Info label**: Displays the duration and number of selected tracks.
  Press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`A` to get the total duration of the AutoDJ queue.
* **Enable Auto DJ button**: Toggles the Auto DJ mode on or off.

The :guilabel:`Skip track`, :guilabel:`Add Random` and :guilabel:`Fade now`
buttons are only accessible if the Auto DJ mode is enabled. The Search field in
the upper left corner is disabled in Auto DJ. By default, Auto DJ removes tracks
after playing them but if you want it to play the same tracks over and over
again, you can activate the :guilabel:`Auto DJ Requeue` option in
:menuselection:`Preferences --> Auto DJ --> Re-queue tracks after playback`.

.. _library-auto-dj-crates:

**Auto DJ Crates**

It is possible to add random tracks to the bottom of the Auto DJ playlist. The
tracks are chosen from a set of crates that you have set as a source for
Auto DJ, or from the standard library. Mixxx will normally try to select tracks
that haven't yet been played. You can set a minimum number of tracks that are
always available for selection no matter when they were last played in
:menuselection:`Preferences --> Auto DJ --> Minimum available tracks in Track Source`.

.. _library-playlists:

Playlists - Arranging tracks in a set order
===========================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_playlist| Playlists are ordered lists of tracks that allow you to plan
your DJ sets. Some DJs construct playlists before they perform live; others
prefer to build them on-the-fly.

Playlists are not directly loadable into decks as Mixxx is primarily
intended for live, attended performance use. However, you can right-click a
playlist to queue it to :ref:`Auto DJ <library-auto-dj>`, so in a sense you can
"play" it.

* **Create a playlist**:  Right-click on the :guilabel:`Playlists` sidebar item
  and select :guilabel:`Create New Playlist`. Name the playlist and click
  :guilabel:`OK`. The total number of tracks and total duration are displayed
  next to the name.
* **Import playlists**:
  Right-click on the :guilabel:`Playlists` sidebar item
  and select :guilabel:`Import Playlist`. Select one or more playlists and click
  :guilabel:`OK`. Mixxx creates an import of these existing external playlists
  as new Mixxx playlists.
* **Add Tracks**: Add tracks to a previously created playlist by
  dragging-and-dropping a selection of tracks from the library or playlists onto
  the name of a playlist in the sidebar. Alternatively, use the right-click
  context menu in the library's :ref:`track list <library-tracks>`.

  .. hint:: If you have a track selected in the library, all of the visible
            playlist and crates that it is in are shown in bold.

Right-click on an existing playlist name to access the different features in
the context menu:

* **Add to Auto DJ**: Adds the content of the playlist to the
  :ref:`Auto DJ <library-auto-dj>` queue for automatic mixing.
* **Rename**: To rename a playlist, just enter a new playlist name and click
  :guilabel:`OK`.
* **Duplicate**: Sometimes you want to build a playlist based on an existing one.
  Select the playlist you would like to duplicate, choose
  :guilabel:`Duplicate Playlist`, name the new playlist and click :guilabel:`OK`.
* **Remove**: Removes an unlocked playlist. Tracks that were in the playlist
  remain in the library for later use.
* **Lock**: |ic_lib_locked| This icon indicates a locked playlist. If a playlist
  is locked, you cannot add tracks, rename or delete the playlist. Choose
  :guilabel:`Unlock` from the context menu to unlock the playlist.
* **Analyze entire playlist**: Forces the analysis of the tracks in the playlist
  in the :ref:`Analyze <library-analyze>` view.
* **Import playlist**: Import tracks from external playlists in various file
  formats to the selected playlist. For more information, go to
  :ref:`library-third-party`.
* **Export playlist**: Export a playlist to various file formats such as
  :file:`m3u`, :file:`m3u8`, :file:`pls`, :file:`txt`, or :file:`csv`.
  This allows you to use the data in other applications.
* **Export Track files**: This copies all of the tracks in a playlist into a
  folder such as an external USB stick. Only files are copied, not
  Mixxx-specific metadata like waveforms or cover art that is not embedded in
  the file.

.. _library-crates:

Crates - Organizing tracks into collections
===========================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_crates|  Crates are unordered collections of tracks, just like DJ cases
holding your favorite records.

* **Create a crate**: Right-click on the :guilabel:`Crates` sidebar item and
  select :guilabel:`Create New Crate`. Name the crate and click :guilabel:`OK`.
  The total number of tracks and total duration are displayed next to the name.
* **Import crates**:
  Right-click on the :guilabel:`Crates` sidebar item
  and select :guilabel:`Import Crate`. Select one or more playlists and click
  :guilabel:`OK`. Mixxx creates an import of these existing external playlists
  as new Mixxx crates.
* **Add Tracks**: Add tracks to a previously created crate by
  dragging-and-dropping a selection of tracks from the library or playlists onto
  the name of a crate in the sidebar. Alternatively use the context menu in the
  library's :ref:`track list<library-tracks>`.

Right-click on an existing crate's name to access the different features in the
context menu:

* **Rename**: To rename a crate, enter the new crate name and click
  :guilabel:`OK`.
* **Duplicate**: Just like playlists you can duplicate an existing crate.
  Select the crate you would like to duplicate, choose
  :guilabel:`Duplicate Crate`, name the new crate and click :guilabel:`OK`.
* **Remove**: Removes an unlocked crate. Tracks in the crate are still available
  in the library for later use.
* **Lock**: |ic_lib_locked| This icon indicates a locked crate. If a crate is
  locked, you cannot add tracks, rename or delete the crate. Choose
  :guilabel:`Unlock` from the context menu to unlock the crate.
* **Auto DJ Track Source**: Use this crate as a source for random tracks in
  Auto DJ, see :ref:`Auto DJ crates <djing-auto-dj-crates>` .
* **Analyze entire crate**: Forces the analysis of the crate in the
  :ref:`Analyze <library-analyze>` view.
* **Import crate**: Import tracks from external playlists in various file
  formats to the selected crate.
* **Export crate**: Export a crate to various file formats, such as
  :file:`m3u`, :file:`m3u8`, :file:`pls`, :file:`txt`, or :file:`csv`. This
  allows you to use the data in other applications.
* **Export Track files**: This copies all of the tracks in a crate into a folder
  such as an external USB stick. Only files are copied, not Mixxx-specific
  metadata like waveforms or cover art that is not embedded in the file.

Crates vs. Playlists
--------------------

Crates are unordered collections of tracks. Unlike playlists, they cannot
contain duplicate entries and do not support arranging tracks within them.

Often DJs group tracks by genre, keep lists of favorite tracks, and/or prepare
lists of tracks they want to play at a particular party. In these cases they
rarely care about the order since they will choose it at the party based on the
dance floor and mood. They certainly don't want duplicates in these lists.
Crates serve these purposes. You can think of them like labels in GMail or Web
2.0 tags for your music.

If however you want to plan out a specific set and practice the transitions,
you will want an ordered list of tracks. Playlists serve this purpose.


.. _library-computer:

Computer - Loading tracks from anywhere on your computer
========================================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_browse| This mode works like a file manager and allows you to load
tracks from anywhere on your computer and connected devices, that are not
necessarily already in your Mixxx library.

Click the :guilabel:`Computer` sidebar item to navigate the computer and find
your music. Depending on your :term:`operating system`, your music will usually
be found in the “My Music” or “Music” folder. Drag the files you want to import
to the |ic_lib_library| :ref:`Tracks <library-tracks>` icon or directly to the
:ref:`interface-waveform`.

.. note:: Currently you can only drag files (not folders) to the Mixxx library.

Right-click on a folder and choose :guilabel:`Add to Library` to add the folder
as an additional music directory. Mixxx will watch this directory and its
subdirectories for new tracks.

.. seealso:: For more information, go to :ref:`configuration-import`.

Quick Links - Bookmark your favorite folders
--------------------------------------------

Using the :guilabel:`Quick Links` sub-menu you can bookmark folders for direct
access. Click the :guilabel:`Browse` sidebar item and navigate to the folder you
would like to bookmark. Right-click and choose :guilabel:`Add to Quick Links`.
The folder is now pinned below the :guilabel:`Quick Links`. To un-pin that
folder, right-click and choose :guilabel:`Remove from Quick Links`.

Recordings
==========

|ic_lib_recordings| In this section of the library you can start and stop
recording your session as well as view previous recordings and the dates they
were made.

.. seealso:: For more information, go to :ref:`djing-recording-your-mix`.

.. _library-history:

History - Keep track of your sessions
=====================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

|ic_lib_history| The history section automatically keeps a list of tracks you
play in your DJ sets. This is handy for remembering what worked in your DJ sets,
posting set-lists, or reporting your plays to licensing organizations. Every
time you start Mixxx, a new history section is created. If you don't play any
tracks during the session, it will be discarded.

|ic_lib_history_current| This icon indicates the current session.

Click on the *History* icon in the sidebar to switch to the :guilabel:`History`
view, then right-click on a session's name/date to access the different features:

* **Add to Auto DJ**: Adds the content of the session to the
  :ref:`Auto DJ <djing-auto-dj>` queue for automatic mixing.
* **Rename**: Rename a session. The default is the calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD).
* **Remove**: Remove a previous (unlocked) session. (You cannot remove the
  current session.)
* **Lock**: Protect a previous session against accidental merge or deletion. An
  |ic_lib_locked| icon indicates a locked session.
* **Create new history playlist**: Split off the current history session and
  add a new session without having to restart Mixxx. The current history must
  contain at least one track for this option to be available.
* **Join with previous**: Append the selected history session to the end of the
  previous one.
* **Export playlist**: Export a session in various file formats. This allows you
  to use the data in other applications.


.. _library-analyze:

Analyze - Prepare your tracks
=============================

This section allows you to analyze your tracks in advance of loading them into
a deck. Analyzing tracks requires considerable CPU power and may cause skips in
the audio while performing, so it helps to have your tracks analyzed before you
play. See :ref:`getting-started-analyze-library` for details.


.. _library-third-party:

iTunes, Traktor, Rhythmbox, Banshee - Using external libraries
==============================================================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

Supported libraries:

* |ic_lib_itunes| `iTunes <https://www.apple.com/itunes/>`_ (Windows, macOS)
* |ic_lib_traktor| `Traktor <https://www.native-instruments.com/en/catalog/traktor/>`_ (Windows, macOS)
* |ic_lib_rhythmbox| `Rhythmbox <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox>`_ (GNU/Linux)
* |ic_lib_banshee| `Banshee <http://banshee.fm/>`_ (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux)

The external library views allow you to use music libraries you have created
in these third-party applications. You can access music as well as playlists. If
available, Mixxx automatically loads the external libraries from their default
locations on your hard drive.

.. note:: Playing a track from an external library will add it to your Mixxx
          library.

Right-click on the iTunes icon in the Library tree and select
:guilabel:`Choose Library` to load the :file:`iTunes Music Library.xml` from a
different location. Select :guilabel:`Use Default Library` to reset.

* Right-click on a iTunes/Traktor/Rhythmbox/Banshee playlist and choose
  :guilabel:`Import Playlist` to import it into a new Mixxx playlist.
* If you have an iTunes configuration file (:file:`\*.xml`) from a Windows or
  Mac partition mounted in Linux, you can load it and use your iTunes tracks and
  playlists as well.

.. seealso:: External libraries can be disabled under
             :menuselection:`Preferences --> Library`.

.. _library-removing-tracks:

Removing tracks from the library
================================

Removing tracks from the Mixxx library will **not** physically delete them from
your drive. However it does delete extra metadata Mixxx might have (such as
hotcues and the beatgrids), and removes links to playlists or crates.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Library` item in the sidebar.
#. Find and select the tracks you want to remove, perform a right-click on them
   and select :guilabel:`Hide from Library` from the context menu.
#. Expand the :guilabel:`Library` item in the sidebar and click on the
   :guilabel:`Hidden tracks` sub-item. All tracks that were set to be hidden
   from the library will appear here.
#. Select the tracks you want to remove, or use the :guilabel:`Select All`
   button.
#. To confirm you want to permanently remove these tracks from the library,
   click :guilabel:`Purge`.

.. hint:: If you later decide to add some of the deleted tracks back, import
          them to the Mixxx library again, see :ref:`configuration-import`.

.. _getting-started-file-format-compatibility:

Compatible file formats
=======================
Mixxx supports a variety of audio file formats:

+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Lossless                               | Lossy                               |
+========================================+=====================================+
| :term:`FLAC` (flac)                    | :term:`MP3` (mp3)                   |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| :term:`Wave <WAV>` (wav)               | :term:`Ogg Vorbis` (ogg)            |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| :term:`Aiff <AIFF>` (aiff, aif)        | :term:`AAC` (aac, m4a, mp4)         |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
|                                        | :term:`Opus` (opus)                 |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

Lossless formats preserve every detail of the original recording and are
recommended for the best sound quality. The :file:`FLAC` format compresses the
files to take less space on your computer without sacrificing audio quality.
:file:`WAV` and :file:`AIFF` files are uncompressed and take up much more space.

Lossy formats take up less storage space on your computer than lossless
formats at the expense of reducing sound quality. Assuming an average track
length of about 4 minutes, a 1 TB hard drive or solid state drive can store
about 42000 :file:`FLAC` files or about 115000 :file:`MP3` files at 320 kbps.

There is no benefit to converting lossy file to lossless formats. The detail
lost when making the lossy file cannot be recovered.

:file:`AAC (M4A)` is supported on Windows Vista and macOS 10.8 onwards. The
`Platform Update Supplement <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2117917/platform-update-supplement-for-windows-vista-and-for-windows-server-20>`_
is required for Windows Vista.

On Linux, :file:`AAC` playback is disabled by default due to licensing restrictions.
To enable the playback of :file:`AAC` files,
`build Mixxx from source with m4a/AAC files support <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Compiling-On-Linux#user-content-optional-build-with-m4aaac-file-support>`_.

.. warning:: :term:`DRM` protected files, such as m4p files purchased in the
             iTunes Store in 2009 or earlier, are not supported.

.. warning:: :term:`ALAC` files use the same container MP4 container format
             and file extensions (m4a, mp4) as AAC files, but Mixxx cannot
             play ALAC files. It is recommended to convert ALAC files to FLAC
             for use in Mixxx. This will not reduce the sound quality of the
             files.

Music from audio CDs
====================
Mixxx can not play music directly from audio CDs. Use a CD ripping program to
copy the audio from the CD to files on your computer. It is recommended to
save the ripped files in the :term:`FLAC` format. Many different programs are
available to rip CDs, but not every program is capable of saving them to
:file:`FLAC`.
