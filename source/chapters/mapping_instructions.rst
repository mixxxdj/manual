   Mixxx Controller Wizard -  Mapping a control

By far, the easiest way to create a new MIDI mapping is by using the Controller
Wizard.

#. Connect your controller(s) to your computer
#. Start Mixxx
#. Go to :menuselection:`Preferences --> Controllers`
#. Select your device from the list of available devices on the left, and the
   right pane will change
#. Activate the :guilabel:`Enabled` checkbox
#. Click on :guilabel:`Learning Wizard` to open the selection dialog
#. Click any control in the Mixxx :term:`GUI`
#. Alternatively, click the :guilabel:`Choose Control` button and choose one
   from the selection list
#. Push :guilabel:`Learn` and then move a control or push a button on your
   controller to map it.  You can also move a control without pushing the
   :guilabel:`Learn` button if you are learning many controls.
#. If you are learning a button, just push it once.  If you are learning a knob
   or a slider, try to move it throughout its range.
#. After Mixxx detects the control, you may click :guilabel:`Learn Another` or
   you can click on another button in the Mixxx :term:`GUI` to learn another
   control.
#. When you are finished mapping controls, click :guilabel:`Done`

There are also some advanced options in the Midi Wizard you may need to use:

* Soft Takeover: Use this option for knobs or sliders to avoid sudden jumps in
  when the knob in the :term:`GUI` doesn't match the physical knob. If you
  select this option, you won't be able to perform super-fast motions as easily.
  (Recommended off)
* Invert: Use this option for controls that you want to work backwards from how
  they were detected.
* Switch Mode: Use this option on controllers that have controls that act like
  switches and emit one value on the first press, and a different value on the
  next press. (Think an actual hardware toggle switch, or a button that lights
  up on the first press and turns off on the second press).
* Jog Wheel / Select Knob:  Use this for knobs that don't have a beginning or an
  end, but spin continuously.

The Controller wizard saves the new mapping to the following file paths:

* Linux: :file:`/home/<username>/.mixxx/controllers`
* macOS: :file:`/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/org.mixxx.mixxx/Data/Library/Application Support/Mixxx/controllers`
* Windows: :file:`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Mixxx\\controllers`

You can then modify the XML file it creates (or any of the ones that
ship with Mixxx) if you'd like to fine-tune it or add more mappings. For more
information, go to
`<https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/MIDI-Controller-Mapping-File-Format>`_.

The Controller Wizard works only for :term:`MIDI` devices. Currently you can't
map modifier (shift) keys and platter rotations. Use :ref:`MIDI Scripting
<advanced-controller-midiscript>` instead.

Adding mapping for your HID Controller

Scripting
=========

In order to support the advanced features of many :term:`MIDI`/:term:`HID`
controllers, Mixxx offers what we call MIDI Scripting.

It enables MIDI controls to be mapped to `QtScript
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QtScript>`_ (aka Javascript/EMCAScript) functions
stored in function library files, freeing Mixxx from a one-to-one MIDI mapping
ideology. These user-created functions can then do anything desired with the
MIDI event such as have a single controller button simultaneously affect
two or more Mixxx properties (“controls”), adjust incoming control values to
work better with Mixxx (scratching), display a complex LED sequence, or even
send messages to text displays on the controller.

For more information, go to `<https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/Midi-Scripting>`_
and `<https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/hid_mapping_format>`_.
