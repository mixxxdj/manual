Packaging
^^^^^^^^^


* It is no longer necessary to manually copy the udev rule file in packaging scripts. Now pkg-config is used to determine the udevdir used to install the rules file in the CMake install step when CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is ``/`` or ``/usr``.  `#4126 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/4126>`_
* Various build issues on FreeBSD are fixed `#4122 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/4122>`_ `#4123 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/4123>`_ `#4124 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/4124>`_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hotcues
^^^^^^^


* Add hotcue colors and custom labels by right clicking hotcue buttons or right clicking hotcues on overview waveforms `#2016 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2016>`_ `#2520 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2520>`_ `#2238 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2238>`_ `#2560 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2560>`_ `#2557 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2557>`_ `#2362 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2362>`_
* Mouse hover cues on overview waveform to show time remaining until the cue `#2238 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2238>`_

Hotcue & Track Colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add customizable color palettes for hotcue and track colors `#2530 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2530>`_ `#2589 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2589>`_ `#3749 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/3749>`_ `#2902 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2902>`_
* Add hotcue color find-and-replace tool `#2547 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2547>`_

Importing From Other DJ Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Import cue points, track colors, and playlists from Serato file tags & database `#2480 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2480>`_ `#2526 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2526>`_ `#2499 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2499>`_ `#2495 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2495>`_ `#2673 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2673>`_ `#3885 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/3885>`_

  * Note: Mixxx does not yet support multiple loops per track. We are `working on this for Mixxx 2.4 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2194>`_. In Mixxx 2.3, if you import a track with multiple loops from Serato, Mixxx will use the first loop cue as the single loop Mixxx currently supports. The imported loops are still stored in Mixxx's database and are treated as hotcues in Mixxx 2.3. If you do not delete these hotcues, they will be usable as loops in Mixxx 2.4. Serato keeps loops and hotcues in separate lists, but Mixxx does not, so loops from Serato are imported starting as hotcue 9.

* Import cue points, track colors, and playlists from Rekordbox USB drives `#2119 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2119>`_ `#2555 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2555>`_ `#2543 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2543>`_ `#2779 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2779>`_

  * Note: The first Rekordbox memory cue is imported for the main cue button in Mixxx and the remaining Rekordbox memory cues are imported as Mixxx hotcues, starting with the next hotcue number after the last hotcue from Rekordbox.
  * Note: Mixxx does not yet support multiple loops per track. Imported loops from Rekordbox are treated like imported loops from Serato, so refer to the note above for details.

Intro & Outro Cues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Add intro & outro range cues with automatic silence detection `#1242 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/1242>`_
* Show duration of intro & outro ranges on overview waveform `#2089 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2089>`_
* Use intro & outro cues in AutoDJ transitions `#2103 <https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/pull/2103>`_

Deck cloning
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Music Feature Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Note: Users who have not manually corrected keys are advised to clear all keys in their library by pressing Ctrl + A in the library, right clicking, going to Reset -> Key, then reanalyzing their library. This will freeze the GUI while Mixxx clears the keys; this is a known problem that we will not be able to fix for 2.3. Wait until it is finished and you will be able to reanalyze tracks for better key detection results.

* Loaded effects and their parameters are saved and restored when Mixxx restarts
* More transparent sounding equalizers (Biquad Equalizer and Biquad Full Kill Equalizer)
* Improved scratching sounds with jog wheels, vinyl control, and dragging waveforms with the mouse
* Simplified looping and beatjump controls
* Configurable rows of 8 samplers with up to 8 rows available for a total of 64 samplers
* Files loaded to samplers are reloaded when Mixxx restarts
* Improved volume normalization algorithm (EBU-R 128)

* Prevent screensaver from starting while Mixxx is running
* CUP (Cue And Play) cue button mode
* Time remaining and time elapsed now take into account the tempo fader
* Clicking cover art now shows it full size in a separate window
* and of course, lots and lots of bug fixes.

For users upgrading from older versions of Mixxx, we have a few important
announcements. First, if you are using Windows, you will have to uninstall any
old versions of Mixxx before you can install 2.1. How to uninstall Mixxx
varies on different versions of Windows:


* Windows Vista, 7, and 8: `Start > Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a
  Program <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2601726>`_
* Windows 10: `Start > Control Panel > Programs > Programs And Features >
  look for Mixxx > Uninstall <https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028054/windows-repair-or-remove-programs-in-windows-10>`_

If you are upgrading from an older version of Mixxx and have MP3 files in
your library, we have another important announcement. The good news is that we
fixed a bug where the waveforms and audio playback of MP3 files were
misaligned. The bad news is that we have no way of knowing which MP3 files were
affected or how much the offset was. That means that waveforms, beatgrids,
cues, and loops from older versions of Mixxx may be offset by an unknown amount
for any MP3 file. Only MP3 files were affected by this bug; other audio file
types are unaffected. You can either correct your beatgrids and cue points
manually for each track, or you can clear this information for all MP3s and
start fresh. Regardless, we recommend clearing the waveforms for all MP3
files. To clear these, type "location:mp3" into the library search bar, press
Control + A to select all tracks, right click, and select the information you
want to clear from the menu.

In the works for Mixxx 2.2, we have a big redesign of the library GUI. Along
with that will come saving & restoring search queries plus nested crates.
We are also planning on adding support for saving and loading custom effect
chain presets with the ability to import and export them to share online.

Want to help make Mixxx even more awesome? The biggest thing we need is more
people. You do not need to be a programmer to help out. Giving feedback on the
design of new features as they are being made is very valuable. Refer to the
Testing page on the wiki for more information on how to get involved with that.
Reporting bugs and telling us your ideas on the Launchpad bug tracker is a big
help too! We cannot fix problems we do not know about, so please let us know if
you find any issues with Mixxx. If you would like to help translate Mixxx into
another language, refer to the Internationalization wiki page.  Of course, more
programmers could always help. Read the Developer Documentation on the wiki for
tips on getting started contributing code to Mixxx.

We hope you have as much fun with Mixxx as we do!
