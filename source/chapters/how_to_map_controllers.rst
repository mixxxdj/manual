How to add support for new Controllers
***************************************

With several dozens of DJ controllers supported out-of-the-box, Mixxx gives you
comprehensive hardware control for your DJ mixes, see :ref:`control-midi`.

Support for additional devices can be added to Mixxx by creating a new mapping
file. This file tells Mixxx how to translate, or map, :term:`MIDI`/:term:`HID`
messages from a controller into commands that Mixxx understands.

You can download and share custom controller mappings in the
`Mixxx User customizations forums <https://mixxx.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=6>`_.
