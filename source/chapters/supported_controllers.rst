Supported Controllers
*********************


Mixxx supports the following :ref:`controllers <hardware-controllers>` out of the box.
Additional third-party controller mappings that were contributed by the community (but are not yet included in Mixxx) can be found at Mixxx' `Controller Mapping Forum <https://mixxx.discourse.group/c/controller-mappings/10>`__.

.. seealso:: :ref:`control-midi` describes how to configure Mixxx to use controllers.
