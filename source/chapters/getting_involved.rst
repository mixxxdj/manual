Contributing to the Project
***************************

Mixxx is a community-driven project involving many DJs worldwide. Without the
contributions from these DJs, Mixxx would not exist, and we're constantly
looking for more contributors.

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to get involved in Mixxx
development.  First off, to be clear **you don't have to be a programmer to
contribute**.

  support and enhance development.
